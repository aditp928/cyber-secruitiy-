Wow… seems I am never here. The days are flying by too. I love autumn the days are perfect! It is 70 degrees partly sunny slight breeze, Awwwww heaven! Love to lay in the lawn chair and watch the leaves twirl to the ground and listen to the birds play in the leaves.

The hay ride was wonderful… I have a few pics…still do not have them loaded online… lazy???

Hard to believe Kos will start his co-op Jan. 4th! He is so excited too! What a good opportunity for a young adult! A fortune 500 company too! I just hate the idea of him being 10 hours away 🙁 But that is why there are jets! and to make 35 dollars an hour his senior year in this economy is pretty darn good!

Getting my flu shot today… not the H1N1 but I will get that one too if at all possible 🙂
