Today Lane and I went out to buy each of our birthday gifts. His birthday is tomorrow and mine is next week! We thought it might be a good idea to get each other new sunglasses for our up coming cruise.  So that is what we did. He picked out a pair of raybans. as always and I found the cutest pair of pradas that were to die for. anyone who knows me knows I have enough designer sunglasses but who wants to wear last year pradas LOL

Actually this is only my second pair of pradas but I do own a pair of fendis and over 10 pair of perfectly well cared oakleys... so yeah, I have a sunglass fetish

Tomorrow is the super bowl. I arranged for the super bowl to be on Laneâ€™s birthday. hahaahhaha nice of me huh? Well maybe I didnt but now there is two reasons to have a party! Gooooooooooo Colts!

I have really started to work on my new years goal. to lose weight! I have been working out at least 6 days a week the past two weeks and have lost 7 pounds already! woo hoo!
