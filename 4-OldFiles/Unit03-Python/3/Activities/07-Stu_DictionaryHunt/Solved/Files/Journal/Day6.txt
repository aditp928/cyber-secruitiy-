I have an amazingly full next two weeks! Some of it good. some of it not so good! 

Today my youngest is coming home for Easter. He is in virginia doing a co-op making the big bucks 🙂

my oldest cannot come home 🙁

Today is my mother’s 70th birthday and we are throwing her a surprise birthday party! 🙂

Saturday we are having a baby shower for my oldest niece:)

Sunday is Easter 🙂

Monday I have an appointment with my attorney to take my ex back to court because he just dropped child support 115 dollars a week w/o a court order 🙁

Thursday I go to court and with any hopes of due process I should win and be 8,000 richer 🙂

Then my life goes back to a boring lull.
