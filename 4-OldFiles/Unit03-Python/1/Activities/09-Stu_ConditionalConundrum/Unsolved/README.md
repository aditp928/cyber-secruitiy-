# Conditional Conundrum

In this activity, you will be looking through an already written series of conditional statements and variables whilst attempting to uncover what statements will print from each code block.

## Instructions

* Look through the examples and figure out what line will print from each block of conditional code.

* Do not run the code at first and instead see if you can follow the thought process to figure things out.
