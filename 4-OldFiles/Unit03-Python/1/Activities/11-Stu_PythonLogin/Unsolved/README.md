# CLI Login

Time to put everything that you have learned today to the test as you create a basic Command Line Interface (CLI) login system.

## Instructions

* Create an application that takes in some user input for both a `username` and `password`, compares these values to those within the `user_list` and `password_list`, and prints "LOGIN SUCCESSFUL" if a match is found.

    * The two lists are of the same length and those values with matching indexes should be considered a pair. For example: "Laurice" at index 0 in the `user_list` has a password of "HDWTWXht" at index 0 in the `password_list`.
