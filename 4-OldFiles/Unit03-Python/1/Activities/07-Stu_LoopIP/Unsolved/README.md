# Loop IP

In this activity, you have been given two parts of an IP address and will have to paste them together using two different kinds of for loop.

## Instructions

* Start things off by creating a loop that goes through the `networks` list and the `nodes` list at the same time and pairs them together before printing the output to the terminal.

    * This single loop should print out a grand total of 10 complete IP addresses.

* Create a second block of code seperate from the first that will loop through both lists individually and pair ALL of their values together.

    * This nested for loop should print out a grand total of 100 complete IP addresses.
