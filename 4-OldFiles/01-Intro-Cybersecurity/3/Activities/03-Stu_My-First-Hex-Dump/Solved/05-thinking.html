THE NEGLECT OF THINKING</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap fsz5">E<b>VERY</b></span>
man knows there are evils in the
world which need setting right. Every
man has pretty definite ideas as to what these
evils are. But to most men one in par­tic­u­lar
stands out vividly. To some, in fact, this
stands out with such startling vividness that
they lose sight of other evils, or look upon them
as the natural consequences of their own par­tic­u­lar
evil-in-chief.</p>

<p>To the Socialist this evil is the capitalistic
sys­tem; to the pro­hi­bi­tion­ist it is in­tem­per­ance;
to the feminist it is the sub­jec­tion of women; to
the clergyman it is the decline of religion; to
Andrew Carnegie it is war; to the staunch Re­pub­li­can
it is the Demo­cratic Party, and so on,
<i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>I, too, have a pet little evil, to which in more
passionate moments I am apt to attribute all the
others. This evil is the neglect of thinking.
And when I say thinking I mean real thinking,
in­de­pen­dent thinking, hard thinking.</p>

<p>You protest. You say men are thinking more
now than they ever were. You bring out the
almanac to prove by statistics that illiteracy
is declining. You point to our magnificent
libraries. You point to the multiplication of
books. You show beyond a doubt that people
are reading more now than ever before in all
history.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Very well, exactly. That is just the trouble.
Most people, when confronted with a problem,
immediately acquire an inordinate desire to
“read-up” on it. When they get stuck mentally,
the first thing such people do is to run to
a book. Confess it, have you not often been in
a waiting room or a Pullman, noticed people
all about you reading, and finding yourself without
any reading matter, have you not wished
that you had some?—something to “occupy
your mind”? And did it ever occur to you
that you had within you the power to occupy
your mind, and do it more profitably than all
those assiduous readers? Briefly, did it ever
occur to you to <i>think</i>?</p>

<p>Of course you “thought”—in a sense.
Thinking means a variety of things. You may
have looked out of your train window while
passing a field, and it may have occurred to you
that that field would make an excellent baseball
diamond. Then you “thought” of the time
when you played baseball, “thought” of some
par­tic­u­lar game perhaps, “thought” how you
had made a grand stand play or a bad muff,
and how one day it began to rain in the middle
of the game, and the team took refuge in the
carriage shed. Then you “thought” of other
rainy days rendered par­tic­u­larly vivid for
some reason or other, or perhaps your mind
came back to considering the present weather,
and how long it was going to last.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And of
course, in one sense you were “thinking.” But
when I use the word thinking, I mean thinking
with a purpose, with an end in view, thinking
to solve a problem. I mean the kind of thinking
that is forced on us when we are deciding
on a course to pursue, on a life work to
take up perhaps; the kind of thinking that was
forced on us in our younger days when we had
to find a solution to a problem in mathematics,
or when we tackled psychology in college. I do
not mean “thinking” in snatches, or holding
petty opinions on this subject and on that. I
mean thought on significant questions which lie
outside the bounds of your narrow personal
welfare. This is the kind of thinking which is
now so rare—so sadly needed!</p>

<p>Of course before this can be revived we must
arouse a desire for it. We must arouse a desire
for thinking for its own sake; solving problems
for the mere sake of solving problems.
But a mere desire for thinking, praiseworthy
as it is, is not enough. We must know <i>how</i> to
think, and to that end we must search for those
rules and methods of procedure which will
most help us in thinking creatively, originally,
and not least of all surely, correctly.</p>

<p>When they think at all, the last thing men
think about is their own thoughts. Every sensible
man realizes that the perfection of a mechanical
instrument depends to some extent
upon the perfection of the tools with which it
is made. No carpenter would expect a perfectly
smooth board after using a dented or
chipped plane. No gasolene engine manufacturer
would expect to produce a good motor unless
he had the best lathes obtainable to help
him turn out his product. No watchmaker
would expect to construct a perfectly accurate
timepiece unless he had the most delicate and
accurate tools to turn out the cogs and screws.
Before any specialist produces an instrument he
thinks of the tools with which he is to produce
it. But men reflect continually on the most
complex problems—problems of vital importance
to them—and expect to obtain satisfactory
solutions, without once giving a thought to
the manner in which they go about obtaining
those solutions; without a thought to their own
mind, the tool which produces those solutions.
Surely this deserves at least some sys­tem­at­ic
con­si­der­a­tion.</p>

<p>Some remarks of Ella Wheeler Wilcox under
this head will bear quoting: “Human thinking
is still in as great a state of disorder and jumble
as language was before the alphabet, music
before the scale was discovered, printing
before Gutenberg, or mathematics before Pythagoras
formulated its laws.” “This sys­tem­a­ti­za­tion
of all thought,” she tells us, would be “a
more far reaching improvement than all the
others, for it will do for education, health,
economics, government, etc., what the alphabet
did for language, movable type for printing
and literature, the scale for music, and
the rules of arithmetic for calculation. Being
the exact counterpart of these in its par­tic­u­lar
field, its mission, like theirs, will be to bring
order out of chaos.”</p>

<p>I believe Miss Wilcox exaggerates mat­ters.
Incidentally I for one do not pretend to have
dis­covered anything rev­o­lu­tionary. But the im­portance
of the subject warrants its formulation
into as near scientific form as we can
bring it.</p>

<p>I beg no one to get frightened. Science does
not necessarily mean test tubes and telescopes.
I mean science in its broadest sense; and in
this sense it means nothing more than organized
knowledge. If we are to find rules and
methods of procedure, these methods must
come from somewhere—must be based on
certain prin­ci­ples—and these prin­ci­ples can come
only from close, sys­tem­at­ic investigation.</p>

<p>It may indeed be urged that we can think
best by disregarding all “rules,” by not paying
any attention to method. But the man who
maintains this must give reasons; and once he
attempts this he himself is bordering closely on
the science of the matter. In short, the settlement
of even this question is part of the science
of thinking.</p>

<p>And what is to be the nature of this science?</p>

<p>For our purposes, all sciences may be divided
into two kinds: <i>positive</i> and <i>normative</i>.
A positive science investigates the nature of
things as they are. It deals simply with matters
of fact. Such a science is physics, chemistry,
psychology. A normative science is one
which studies things as they ought to be. As
the name implies, it seeks to establish a <i>norm</i>
or pattern which ought to be adhered to. It
studies means of reaching desired ends. To
this class belong such sciences as ethics, education,
agriculture.</p>

<p>Now these normative sciences, with the
exception of ethics, are nearly always referred to
either as “arts” or “applied sciences.” To
both of these terms I technically but strenuously
object. I object to the term “art” to
designate any set of organized rules for doing
a thing, because “art” also means the actual
doing of that thing. And this thing may be
done, and often is done, in total ignorance of
the rules governing it. A man may possess the
art of swimming—he may be able to swim—without
any previous instruction, without any
knowledge of how he ought to hold his body,
arms and legs; just as a dog may do the same
thing.</p>

<p>I object also to the term “applied science,”
because to me this term implies that the science
it refers to is based on one positive science only.
I can think of no so-called applied science which
is so based. Hygiene, not alone dependent on
physiology, must derive some of its rules from
the chemistry of foods, as well as from the sciences
of sanitation and ventilation, themselves
normative. Agriculture is based not only on
biology and botany, but on chemistry and meteorology.</p>

<p>The science of thinking, then, if such a science
there be, is normative. Its purpose is to
find those methods which will help us to think
constructively and correctly.</p>

<p>One more distinction and our preliminaries
are over. There are two other sciences with
which the science of thinking is liable to become
confused; one positive, the other normative.</p>

<p>The positive science is that branch of psychology
which deals with the reasoning process and
examines the basis of belief. We shall make
frequent use of this science in trying to find
rules for thinking, but it will not be the only
science we shall use, nor will that science be the
subject of this book.</p>

<p>The normative science with which the science
of thinking may become confused is logic.
Indeed, logic has sometimes been called the science
of thinking. Now for our purposes logic
is a part of the science of thinking, but it is not
the part which we are primarily to consider.
Its function is merely negative; it consists in
leading us from error. The part of the science
of thinking in which we are interested deals
with those positive rules which will help to make
us creative thinkers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Our ship is headed for the port Truth. Our
mind is the engine, the science of thinking the
propeller, and logic the rudder. Without our
engine, the mind, the propeller of the science
of thinking, which transforms our mental energy
most effectively into motion, would be useless.
Without the propeller, which gives motion, the
rudder of logic would be useless. But all three
are needed to reach our goal.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>And now I must bespeak a little patience.
The next chapter, and the one following it, are
going to deal very largely with method and
methods. They will touch on clas­si­fi­ca­tion, and
a lot of other things to which the plain man has
an aversion; to which, at least, he usually
evinces no very active interest. But it is necessary
to consider these things in order to make
our study complete.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section" id="p011">
<h2 class="h2herein">II <span class="hsmall">
THINKING WITH METHOD</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">Most of us, at those rare intervals when
we think at all, do so in a slipshod sort
of way. If we come across a mental difficulty
we try to get rid of it in almost any kind of
hit or miss manner. Even those few of us who
think occasionally for the mere sake of thinking,
generally do so without regard for method—indeed,
are often unconscious that method
could be applied to our thought. But what is
meant by method? I may best explain by an
example.</p>

<p>From somewhere or other, a man gets hold of
the idea that the proper subjects are not being
taught in our schools and colleges. He
asks himself what the proper subjects would be.
He considers how useless his knowledge of
Greek and Latin has been. He decides that
these two subjects should be eliminated. Then
he thinks how he would have been helped in business
by a knowledge of bookkeeping, and he concludes
that this subject deserves a place in the
curriculum. He has recently received a letter
from a college friend containing some errors in
spelling. He is convinced that this branch of
knowledge is being left in undeserved neglect.
Or he is impressed by the spread of unsound
theories of money among the poorer classes, and
he believes that everybody should receive a
thorough course in economics and finance. And
so he rambles on, now on this subject, now on
that.</p>

<p>Compare this haphazard, aimless thinking
with that of the man of method. This man is
confronted with the same general situation as
our first thinker, but he makes his problem a
different one. He first asks himself what end
he has in view. He discovers that he is primarily
trying to find out not so much—what
subjects should be taught in the schools? as—what
knowledge is of most worth? He puts the
problem definitely before himself in this latter
form. He then sees that the problem—what
knowledge is of <i>most</i> worth?, implies that what
is desired is not to find what subjects are of
worth and what are not, but what is the <i>relative</i>
value of subjects. His next step, obviously,
is to discover a standard by which the
relative value of subjects can be determined;
and this, let us say, he finds in the help a knowledge
of these subjects gives to complete living.
Having decided this, he next classifies in
the order of their importance the activities
which constitute human life, and follows this
by classifying subjects as they prepare for these
activities.<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn1" id="fnanc1">1</a></p>

<p>Needless to say, the results obtained by this
thinker will be infinitely more satisfactory than
those arrived at by his unsys­tem­at­ic brother.
Method, then, is essential. But how are we to
apply it in all cases?</p>

<p>Now there are methods without number, and
in many cases a problem will require a method
all its own; but we here purpose to take up only
those most general in application.</p>

<p>Before considering these methods of thinking,
however, it would be well to ask ourselves
what thinking is. As stated before, the term is
loosely used to cover a wide range of mental
processes. These processes we may roughly divide
into memory, imagination and reasoning.
It is the last only with which we have to deal.
I admit that development of the memory is desirable.
I admit that development of the imagination
is equally desirable. But they are not
the subject of this book. By “thinking” I
mean reasoning. And our present purpose is
to find the nature of this process.</p>

<p>Modern psychologists tell us that all reasoning
begins in perplexity, hesitation, doubt.
“The process of reasoning is one of problem
solving. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The occasion for the reasoning is
always a thwarted purpose.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn2" id="fnanc2">2</a></p>

<p>It is essential we keep this in mind. It differs
from the popular conception even more
than may appear at first sight. <i>If a man were
to know everything he could not think.</i> Nothing
would ever puzzle him, his purposes would
never be thwarted, he would never experience
perplexity or doubt, he would have no problems.
If we are to conceive of God as an All-Knower,
we cannot conceive of Him as a Thinking
Being. Thinking is reserved for beings of finite
intelligence.</p>

<p>Were we to study the origin and evolution
of thinking, we would doubtless find that thinking
arose in just this way—from thwarted purposes.
If our lives and the lives of our animal
ancestors had always run smoothly, if our every
desire were immediately satisfied, if we never
met an obstacle in anything we tried to do,
thinking would never have appeared on this
planet. But adversity forced us to it.</p>

<p>Tickle a frog’s left leg, and his right leg will
immediately fly up and scratch it. The action
is merely what psychologists would call a “reflex.”
Absolutely no thinking takes place: the
frog would do the same thing if you removed
its brain. And if you tickle its right leg its
left leg would fly up to scratch. But if you
tickled both legs at once they could not both fly
up and scratch each other. It would be a physical
impossibility. Here, then, is a difficulty.
The frog hesitates; thinking steps upon the
scene. After mature deliberation the frog
solves his problem: he holds his left leg still
while he scratches it with his right, then he
holds his right leg still and scratches that with
his left.</p>

<p>We cannot, then, think on “general prin­ci­ples.”
To try this is like attempting to chew
laughing gas. To think at all requires a purpose,
no matter how vague. The best thinking,
however, requires a definite purpose, and the
more definite this purpose the more definite will
be our thinking. Therefore in taking up any
special line of thought, we must first find just
what our end or purpose is, and thus get clearly
in mind what our problems are.</p>

<p>Advising a man to ask himself what his prob­lems
are may seem absurd. But it is just this
con­fusion as to what they want to know
which has driv­en men into error time and time
again. The history of the never-end­ing phil­o­soph­i­cal
con­tro­ver­sy be­tween “ma­te­ri­al­ism”
and “idealism” is largely a his­tory of dif­ferent
ways of stat­ing the issue; the pro­gress made
is mainly due to the in­creasing de­fi­nite­ness with
which it has been stated.</p>

<p>One of the most frequent sources of confusion
in stating questions is in failure to distinguish
between what is and what ought to be.
Considering woman suffrage a man will ask
himself “What is woman’s sphere?,” when he
really wants to know not what woman’s sphere
actually is, but what it ought to be. Our first
step, then, is to get our problem or problems
clearly in mind, and to state them as definitely
as possible. A problem properly stated is a
problem partly solved.</p>

<p>What we will do next depends on the nature
of the question. In the example “What knowledge
is of most worth?” we proceeded to look
for a criterion of worthiness. And this was
really a re-stating of the question. For instead
of asking ourselves “What knowledge is of
most worth?,” we began asking “What knowledge
best prepares for complete living?”</p>

<p>Our next move was to classify. This is essential
not only to sys­tem­at­ic reasoning but to
thinking of any kind. Clas­si­fi­ca­tion is the
process of grouping objects according to common
qualities. But as almost all objects differ
in some qualities and almost all have some
qualities in common, it follows that, contrary to
common belief, <i>there is no one clas­si­fi­ca­tion absolutely
essential to any group of objects</i>. An
infinite number of clas­si­fi­ca­tions may be made,
because every object has an infinite number of
attributes, depending on the aspect we take of
it. Nor is any one aspect of a thing “truer”
than any other. The aspect we take depends
entirely on the purpose we have in mind or the
problem we wish to solve. As William James
pointed out:</p>

<p>“Now that I am writing it is essential that
I conceive my paper as a surface for inscription.
If I failed to do that I should have to
stop my work. But if I wished to light a fire
and no other materials were by, the essential
way of conceiving the paper would be as combustible
material; and I need then have no
thought of any of its other destinations. It is
really all that it is: a combustible, a writing
surface, a thin thing, a hydro­car­bon­a­ceous
thing, a thing eight inches one way and ten another,
a thing just one furlong east of a certain
stone in my neighbor’s field, an American thing,
etc., etc., <i>ad infinitum</i>.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn3" id="fnanc3">3</a></p>

<p>And if the reader insist that these qualities
are merely “accidental,” and that what the
thing really is, is just <i>paper</i> and nothing else,
the reply is that the reader is in­tel­lec­tually petrified;
that though “paper” may be our commonest
title for it and may suggest our usual
purpose with it, yet that purpose and this title
and the properties which this title suggest have
in reality nothing sacramental about them.</p>

<p>So because you have classified something
from one aspect do not imagine that you are
necessarily precluded from classifying it from
any other. A man who is studying the theory
of money may divide the medium of exchange
into standard money and credit currency. But
this need not keep him from viewing it as coins,
government notes, and bank currency, nor
should it prevent him from classifying it into,
say (1) hand-to-hand money, (2) written or
printed orders of one party to pay specified
sums to another, and (3) book accounts.<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn4" id="fnanc4">4</a> All
these clas­si­fi­ca­tions will be true; all may be useful
for a full comprehension. Every clas­si­fi­ca­tion
should of course be logical; but it is far
more essential that it be utilizable.</p>

<p>And while we are treating of utility, we
might note that this <i>pragmatic</i> method can be
applied with profit to nearly all our positive
problems. Before starting to solve a question—while
deciding, for instance, on the validity
of some nice distinction in logic—we should ask
ourselves, “What practical difference will it
make if I hold one opinion or the other? How
will my belief influence my action?”—(using
the word “action” in its broadest sense). This
may often lead our line of inquiry into more
fruitful channels, keep us from making fine but
needless distinctions, help us to word our question
more relevantly, and lead us to make distinctions
where we really need them.</p>

<p>We are now ready to consider in order a number
of constructive methods in thinking.</p>

<p>One method applicable to almost all problems
is what we may call either the <i>deductive</i> or the
<i>à priori</i> method. This method reaches a conclusion
without observation or experiment. It
consists in reasoning from previous experience
or from established prin­ci­ples to par­tic­u­lar
facts. It may, however, be used to confirm observation
and experiment as well as to take
their place. Take the all important questions in
biology of whether or not specific char­ac­ter­is­tics
acquired by an animal during its life time
are inherited by offspring. The a priori
method would examine the structures of the
body, the germ plasm from which the offspring
develops, and the relation between them, and
would ask just how a specific change in the body
could affect the germ. If it were found that the
tissues that are to continue the race were set
off so completely from the structures of the
body as to make inconceivable any manner by
which they could be influenced by changes in
these structures, then this method would decide
that acquired char­ac­ter­is­tics are not transmitted.</p>

<p>Let us take another example. Both the supporters
and opponents of woman suffrage have
often decided the question without consulting
at all the actual results achieved in the States
where women vote. They have settled the question
to their own satisfaction merely on a priori
grounds. They have considered woman’s supposed
mental qualities as compared with man’s,
and have decided on her fitness for the ballot
solely from these con­si­der­a­tions. It must be
remembered, however, that before women were
admitted to suffrage anywhere, deductive or a
priori reasoning was the only kind possible.</p>

<p>It is often helpful to look at a problem from
the viewpoint of different sciences. A problem
in po­li­ti­cal science will very likely have an economic
aspect, whether it concerns taxation,
tariff, trusts or the ownership of land, and so
we may look at the question solely from the
viewpoint of economics. But the problem may
also have an ethical aspect. If it is proposed
to pass a universal prohibition law, you may
ask, “Has the Government the right to interfere
in this way with personal liberty?”
Again, we could take a psy­cho­log­i­cal view:
we would decide from our knowledge of human
nature just what the effect of an alcohol prohibition
law would be—whether it would not
drive men to even more dangerous drugs, such
as morphine and opium.</p>

<p>And now we come to a whole host of effective
methods, all of which may be classed as comparative.
The comparative method is as old as
thought itself, but it is strange that even scientists
did not begin to use it consciously and
consistently until almost the present generation.
Nowhere is it better illustrated than in modern
psychology. Most of the so-called branches
of psychology are merely different forms of
the comparative method of treatment. “Abnormal
psychology” is merely a comparison of
abnormal mental types with normal mental
types for the light they throw on each other.
“Child study” is a comparison of the mind
of the child with that of the adult. “Animal
psychology” is a comparison of the actions of
animals with each other and with those of man.
And none of these methods is of any value except
in so far as it makes use of comparison.</p>

<p>Often consciously used in the con­si­der­a­tion
of problems is the so-called historical method.
This method, as its name implies, consists in
obtaining knowledge of a thing by considering
its past record. The word history is popularly
used in so narrow a sense, however, being restricted
only to the history of nations, and
often merely to the political history of nations,
that we can avoid confusion by calling this
method the evolutionary. In the final analysis
the method is comparative, for it really
consists in comparing a thing at one period of development
with itself at another period.</p>

<p>Let us take our example from political science.
The historical method, in its popular
sense, has been so much used here, even to the
exclusion of other methods, that it would seem
needless to speak of it. But often the method
has been abused and often it has not been given
broad enough treatment. It traces the growth
of an institution, or of an idea—personal
liberty, say,—through successive periods. It
notes what the path has been, and judges of the
probable future tendency. But a far broader
outlook than we get from this narrowly conceived
“historical” method is furnished by evolutionary
sociology. Here we inquire into the
origin of society and of the various trades, industries,
professions and pursuits of all kinds,
and to do this we go far into prehistoric times.</p>

<p>Nowhere is the evolutionary method more
strikingly seen than in biology. Since Darwin’s
great theory was promulgated the science
has gone forward by leaps and bounds. We
have derived untold benefit from a comparison
of man and animals in the light of this
hypothesis; even study of the development of individual
man has been aided. The discovery of the
<i>fact</i> of evolution constituted an incalculable advance,
but the method for study which it furnished
was of even greater importance.</p>

<p>I have spoken of the comparison of man and
animals “in the light of this (evolutionary)
hypothesis.” This brings us to a point which
must be kept in mind in practically all observation.
We are often exhorted to “observe.”
Presumably we are to do this “on general principles.”
Such advice is about as foolish as
asking us to think on general principles. Imagine
for the moment what would happen if you
started right now to “observe” as much as you
could. You might begin with this book and notice
the size of the type, the amount of margin,
the quality of the paper, the dimensions of
the page, the number of pages. But you have
by no means exhausted the number of properties
possessed by this book. You must observe
that it is also combustible, that it is destructible,
that it is machine made, that it is American
printed, that it is such and such a price,
that it weighs so many ounces, that it is flat,
that it is rectangular, that its thickness is so
much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The absurdity is obvious. If we started out
merely to observe, with no definite purpose in
mind, we could keep it up forever. And get
nowhere. Nine out of every ten observations
would never be put to use. We would be sinfully
wasting our time. To observe most profitably,
just as to think most profitably, we must
have a definite purpose. This purpose must be
<i>to test the truth of a sup­po­si­tion</i>. A concrete
example will make this clear.</p>

<p>A man has been shipwrecked on an island and
believes himself to be alone there. One day,
as he is walking along the beach, he discovers
footprints. How did they get there? His
first assumption is that they are his own. It
occurs to him, however, that he had not been
near this spot for over a week, and that yesterday’s
storm would have washed any footprints
away. This objection is confirmed by making a
footprint himself and comparing it with the
one observed, and noticing that they differ
markedly. The footprints being those of some
one else, how did the man who made them get
there? The first sup­po­si­tion is that he came in
a boat. The idea of a small boat is dismissed
because of the assumed great distance of this
island from other land. Therefore the man
must have come in a large vessel. But the
footprints lead to a wet part of the sand and
the tide is just going down. In this case they
are very recent—made not more than a half
hour ago. This being so the man who made
them could not have had time to get back to
any ship and sail out of sight. If he came in
a ship it should be still in view. The discoverer
of the footprints climbs a tree from which
he can view the sea around the entire island.
He can sight no vessel. The sup­po­si­tion or
hypothesis that the unknown came in a ship is
abandoned. Then the sug­ges­tion comes that the
unknown has been on the island during the entire
time that the shipwrecked man thought himself
alone. This sug­ges­tion is tested in a manner
similar to the others.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The example sums up roughly the general
process of all thought, and brings out the motive
and value of observation. Let us analyze
it.</p>

<p>The first thing to happen is the arousal of
a feeling of perplexity, the appearance of a
problem. The man has been shambling along,
doubtless “thinking” in that loose sense referred
to. He has perhaps kicked several
stones loose that would have set a geologist
worrying, and has picked branches from bushes
which would have puzzled a botanist. But this
man has not had his curiosity aroused until he
has come to these footprints. His thinking
starts with his perplexity. After this doubt
has been aroused the most obvious solution suggests
itself—“my own footprints.” But if
true, this sug­ges­tion involves the co-existence
of other facts, some of which are known and
some of which may be determined. Thus, <i>if</i>
they were his own footprints, it must, among
other things, necessarily follow (1) that he had
been at that spot before, (2) that nothing had
happened since that time to remove the prints,
(3) that the footprints corresponded to his
own. The first consequence involved—that he
had been there before—was a fact, but the
others were not, and so the sug­ges­tion was
dropped. Then a second hypothesis occurred—“the
man came in a ship”—and this was
tried out in a similar way. Notice that in each
case the consequences dependent on the truth
of the sug­ges­tion are tried out (1) by memory,
(2) by observation or experiment. Memory
came when he thought of the last time he had
walked near the beach and of yesterday’s storm.
Observation came when he compared his footprint
with the one seen, when he followed the
footprints along the sand and noticed where
they led, when he climbed a tree and looked for
a ship. There were a number of other things
which he could have observed. He might have
noticed the texture of the sand, what kind of a
tree he was climbing, what sort of clouds were
in the sky. But he did not observe these interesting
things simply because they would throw
no light on the truth or falsity of his sup­po­si­tion.
In another problem one of these facts
might have been of value.</p>

<p>It is almost possible to sum up the whole
process of thinking as the occurrence of sug­ges­tions
for the solution of difficulties and the testing
out of those sug­ges­tions. The sug­ges­tions
or sup­po­si­tions are tested by observation,
memory, experiment. Sup­po­si­tion and observation
alternate. The first facts observed—in
the case foregoing, the footprints—make the
problem, they suggest the sup­po­si­tion. A sup­po­si­tion
is that the man came in a boat. <i>If</i>
the man came in a boat such and such would
be the case—the boat would still be visible, etc.
If the boat is not visible the sup­po­si­tion is given
up and another one made; if the boat is visible
the sup­po­si­tion is confirmed. This is a case of
simple and rudimentary thinking, but it illustrates
roughly the process of thought on even
the most complicated problems of science. The
methods we have been discussing may all be
considered simply as means for helping good
sug­ges­tions occur to us.</p>

<p>Let us illustrate by considering a few
methods of rather restricted application. We
are often aided in the solution of a problem by
asking its opposite. If we ask ourselves
“What constitutes gracefulness?” we may find
ourselves at a loss for sug­ges­tions, because
gracefulness always seems “so natural.” But
if we ask its opposite, “What constitutes
awkwardness?,” sug­ges­tions are more apt to occur.
If we find, for instance, that awkwardness
consists in undue bodily effort in making
a movement, we may assume that gracefulness
consists in ease of movement. In the same way
the question of what makes us forget may be
helped by asking ourselves what makes us remember,
and light may be thrown on the causes
of success in business and in life by a study of
the causes of failure.</p>

<p>The method of analogy likewise encourages
sug­ges­tions. Analogy consists in noting certain
likenesses between things, and assuming
that they also possess other common qualities.
Striking use of analogy is made in dealing with
the planet Mars. At each pole there are
great white patches. The size of these varies
markedly with the seasons, which suggests that
like the earth, Mars has great areas of ice and
snow at its two poles which melt and re-form.
The general surface is reddish, but three-eighths
of it is covered by blue-green tracts,
and these are usually inferred to be seas.
These again are connected by an intricate
system of blue-green lines, which some scientists
believe to be canals, but on this there is much
controversy. In Mars we have at once an illustration
of the possibilities and dangers of
analogy.</p>

<p>In the whole discussion of constructive
method thus far, I have left out the two most
common and useful methods of all. The first of
these we may designate by a somewhat formidable
title: <i>empirical observation</i>. Empirical,
at least for our present purposes, means merely
that which comes within experience. But the
term is generally opposed to scientific. Thus
Dewey gives an example: “A says, ‘It will
probably rain to-morrow.’ B asks, ‘Why do
you think so?’ And A replies, ‘Because the sky
was lowering at sunset.’ When B asks, ‘What
has that to do with it?’ A responds, ‘I do not
know, but it generally does rain after such a
sunset.’ He does not perceive any <i>connection</i>
between the appearance of the sky and the coming
rain; he is not aware of any continuity in
the facts themselves—any law or principle, as
we usually say. He simply, from frequently
recurring conjunction of the events, has
associated them so that when he sees one he thinks
of the other.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn5" id="fnanc5">5</a></p>

<p>This, however, is not what I mean to imply
by the term empirical observation. I mean
rather thinking on the basis merely of facts
which occur in the natural course of events,
which have not been sys­tem­at­ical­ly produced by
ourselves or others for the purpose of solving
a problem. Logicians usually call this method
simply <i>observation</i>, and oppose it to experiment.
But I object to calling this simply observation
because experiment itself is really observation,
only in one case we observe merely
events which happen to occur, and in the other
we observe the results of events <i>which we have
made occur</i>. The true way of dis­tin­guish­ing
these two methods would be to call one <i>empirical
observation</i>, and the other <i>experimental
observation</i>.</p>

<p>This empirical method—if indeed I am justified
in calling it a <i>method</i>—is the most common
in all thinking. To give examples of it
would be to show how men generally think.
But the method has real value, and may even
be the most important of all, for if we thought
without it our ideas would doubtless be original,
but very dangerous. Let us apply it to
some of the problems considered under other
methods.</p>

<p>Empirical observation is used where experiment
is impossible—often, unfortunately, where
experiment is merely inconvenient. In political
science the empirical method would consist in
noting the effect of certain laws,—e.g., tariffs
of different countries and of the same country
at different periods—and noting economic conditions
at the time the different tariffs were in
effect. Allowance would be made for other factors
which could influence the country’s economic
condition and the effect of the tariff could
then be determined.</p>

<p>The empirical method of dealing with meteorology,
the science of weather, would consist
in making a study of cloud formations,
wind velocity, moisture in the air, temperature,
etc., and noting what conditions usually or perhaps
invariably followed certain of these conditions.
From this, conclusions could be drawn
as to what weather to expect following certain
conditions.</p>

<p>But valuable as empirical observation is, and
often as we must use it, it should never be employed
when we can experiment. When the empirical
method is rightly used allowance always
has to be made for certain irrelevant factors.
But “making allowances” is always sheer
guess work. <i>The experimental method consists
not in making allowances for certain factors,
but in eliminating those factors.</i> In our example
from political science experiment is practically
impossible, because the factors which
may influence economic conditions are innumerable,
and even were they few, no country could
survive the dangers of being experimented upon—to
say nothing of its permitting it. Experiment
is similarly impossible in dealing with
weather conditions directly. It is impossible in
astronomy.</p>

<p>But it could be applied quite easily to most
questions. Suppose you wanted to determine
beyond question which of two methods of teaching
a given subject was the better. We shall
assume for the moment that you have unlimited
time and money to experiment. It may be
thought that we could settle this simply by
teaching one person according to one method
and another person according to the other, and
that we could determine the relative merits of
each method from the progress made by each
pupil. This, however, would be practically of
no use whatever. One pupil might be naturally
brighter than the other, and so would naturally
learn quicker, even were he taught by an inferior
method.</p>

<p>To make the experiment of any use we
should first take two <i>groups</i> of pupils—the
larger the better. For it is obvious that if we
take a great number of pupils and place them
in two groups the differences between the individuals
will tend to offset one another. Let
us say the subject is one in which the progress
can be quantitatively measured, say typewriting,
and let us suppose there are fifty pupils
in each group. If after a given time <i>all</i> the pupils
in one group had attained a greater speed
with accuracy than <i>all</i> the pupils in the other,
the test would be almost unquestionable. This
would be even more conclusive if the groups
were reasonably well balanced. For if all of
one group were men and all of the other were
boys, the men might make more rapid progress
than the boys even with a less efficient system.
But it should be easy to divide classes and
groups so as to have a reasonable balance of
intelligence between them. The probable result
of any experiment would be that in neither
class would all the pupils make more progress
than all the pupils of the other, though you
might find that the preponderating majority in
one class improved faster than those in the
other, and this would probably be sufficient to
indicate the superiority of one method, even
though one or two pupils in the second group
progressed faster than one or two in the first.</p>

<p>I say “probably” because there are still
many irrelevant factors which might influence
the result. For instance, if you had a different
teacher for each group, one group might make
greater progress not because of the method
but because of the teacher. This means either
that one teacher should teach both groups, or
that we should multiply the number of groups
and the number of teachers, and have half the
teachers teaching half the groups by one
method, and the other half teaching by the other
method. Of course here too the more we could
multiply the number the better it would be.
Even then there might be some reasonable question
as to the validity of the experiment, for
it might be that one method would tend to encourage
faster progress at the beginning, but
that the other would lead to greater progress in
the long run. This could be determined only
by carrying our experiment over a long period.
And we might still have irrelevant factors, for
the machines on which one group learnt to typewrite
might be superior to those on which the
other group learnt, and this factor would have
to be eliminated in a similar way to the others.</p>

<p>The experimental method has been well
summed up by Thomson and Tait in their <i>Natural
Philosophy</i>:</p>

<p>“In all cases when a par­tic­u­lar agent or
cause is to be studied, experiments should be
arranged in such a way as to lead if possible
to results depending on it alone; or, if this cannot
be done, they should be arranged so as to
increase the effects due to the cause to be studied
till these so far exceed the unavoidable concomitants,
that the latter may be considered as
only disturbing, not essentially modifying the
effects of the principal agent.”</p>

<p>In all experiments one must exercise ingenuity
in finding other causes besides the one to be
studied which may possibly influence a result,
and in eliminating these. It might benefit the
reader considerably if he were to think out for
himself how he would apply experiment in its
most thoroughgoing form to solve a given question,
say the inheritance of acquired char­ac­ter­is­tics.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>I have now cited enough methods to at least
in­di­cate what “thinking with method” means.
To satisfy a certain human craving all of these
have been named, though sometimes arbitrarily.
Of course each may have to be modified to some
extent to adjust it to different problems. I
must repeat: there are methods numberless,
and some problems will require methods all
their own.</p>

<p>But what is important is that every problem
should be dealt with by as many methods as possible.
Doubtless you have used, at some time
or other in the course of your thinking, nearly
every one of the methods I have so far suggested.
But the point is not that you have
never used these methods at all, but that you
have not used them often enough. You were
unaware what method you were using. Consequently
you used it only occasionally. You
used it only when you stumbled on it accidentally.
To formulate methods is to bring
them to your attention, so that you may use
them always, thoroughly, correctly, consistently.</p>

<p>We have treated political science from most
angles. We have applied more than one
method to several other problems. To still
further clarify, exemplify and impress this
point, I shall show the application of method to
one more subject.</p>

<p>Suppose you wanted to invent a system of
shorthand, and wanted to make it as perfect as
possible. How would you go about it?</p>

<p>Your first step should be to restate your question
most advantageously. You want to create
certain characters or symbols, which will (1)
take the shortest time to write, (2) will be easily
recognized by yourself or others, even if written
carelessly, and (3) which will not be so
numerous or so complex as to be difficult to
learn. You may decide that such symbols
would have even further requirements. Next
you should decide on the methods to use in attacking
your problem—this in order not to forget
any. Now assume you have decided on
these methods and that the first is the a priori.
Your conclusion might be that it would be impossible
to have a different symbol for every
word, and that it is necessary to have some sort
of alphabet. Should this alphabet be based on
that used in longhand? That is, should merely
a simpler symbol stand in place of each letter?
Or should a different symbol represent each
sound? Or would it be possible to have a different
elementary symbol for each syllable?
Having decided the basis for your symbols or
characters, you will know at least approximately
the number required. Your problem
will then become that of making the characters
as simple as possible, so that they may be
written most quickly; and yet as different from each
other as possible so that if written carelessly
(as they will be when written swiftly), they may
be easily recognized. You might try writing
down all the simplest symbols you can think of.
Or you might ask yourself whether there is any
fundamental geometrical figure from which you
can derive your symbols. Or you might study
the simplest and easiest movements of the hand,
and base your characters on these.</p>

<p>This a priori method is most apt of all to provoke
real thinking. It should therefore be taken
up before any of the others. Not only is it best
for making you think deeply, but it will be more
likely than any of the others to make you think
originally. However, whether attended by
great or little success, this method should be
followed by others.</p>

<p>Not the least fruitful of these would be the
evolutionary. This, of course, would consist
in studying the history of shorthand, finding out
the direction in which it has been tending, and
thus anticipating in some degree its future development.
As this method is comparative we
would naturally be led from it to comparing the
shorthand systems of to-day, and assaying the
good and bad qualities of each. These could
only be assayed if we knew something of shorthand
theory, and thus our experience with the
deductive or a priori method would be of
service.</p>

<p>Implied in here is a method of different nature
than any we have yet discussed, but one of
immense help. In turning from the deductive
method to a study of shorthand systems which
others have developed, you have an opportunity
to compare the results of your own thinking
with those obtained by others. If you have
failed to solve the question in as good a manner
as these others, you can ask yourself wherein
and why your own reflections and ingenuity fell
short. If you follow this method with all problems—i.e.,
thinking a thing out for yourself before
looking up what others have thought—you
will soon improve your thinking surprisingly.
The method is capable of application in every
problem, from inventing an adding machine to
trying to find how the plumber got that $3.46
on the bill.</p>

<p>But to return to shorthand. We still have
the empirical and experimental methods. In
this par­tic­u­lar case the difference between them
would be simply one of degree. We could find,
for instance, what systems were used by the
fastest shorthand writers; but we could get
nothing conclusive from this, for we would have
to make allowance for the natural ability and
length of training of these writers. From
merely looking at two outlines or characters, it
is often difficult to tell which can be written
faster. This could only be tested by writing
hundreds in a row and finding the time it took
to write the same number of each. Of course
such experiment is capable of indefinite expansion.</p>

<p>In dealing with method heretofore, I have at
times come dangerously near to making a false
assumption. I have been talking as if a man
who took up political science, shorthand, or any
other subject, were dealing with only one problem.
As a matter of fact he is dealing with a
whole series of problems. Just how many it is
difficult to say, because no problem worthy of
the name is an indivisible unit, and may always
be broken into smaller problems. The whole
science of æsthetics is included in the simple
question “What is beauty?”, the science of
ethics is merely the answer to “What is right
conduct?”, and metaphysics may be reduced to
the problem “What is reality?” But when we
come to deal with any of these we instinctively
break them up into smaller and more concrete
problems, making the treatment easier, just as a
general attempts to split his enemy’s forces, so
that he can annihilate one section at a time.
Often, indeed, the very division of the larger
problem into smaller problems constitutes its
solution, for we finally come to a problem which
practically answers itself, and which we recognize
as being included in, or a par­tic­u­lar form
of, some more general problem to which we already
know the answer.</p>

<p>A man sets before himself the question,
“What is the proper sphere of Government?”
Perhaps he will first of all consider certain different
specific activities which might possibly
be supposed to come within the sphere of governmental
interference. He might ask himself,
for instance, “Should the Government interfere
with freedom of contract?” Notice that he has
here temporarily made his problem narrower,
he has chosen to break it up in order to deal
with it part by part. But even when he came
to cope with this smaller problem he would
probably find it necessary to break this up, and
he would therefore take a specific example.
Suppose a man works for so much an hour, and
that nine hours’ work a day gives him the minimum
amount on which he can live and support
his family. Would it be wise to limit the legal
working day of such a man to eight hours?
This problem practically answers itself, and so
further division is unnecessary. Of course the
answer to this does not determine the answer
to the original question, for other parts still remain
to be considered.</p>

<p>In fact, much of the success of our thinking
will depend upon just how we divide our big
problems into subsidiary problems, and just
what our subsidiary or subordinate problems
are. This will depend to some extent on our
own natural sagacity, and to some extent on
mere chance. No rigid rules can be laid down.
The only advice which can be offered is that
when a thinker breaks up a problem he should
do so with an eye to utility and definiteness.</p>

<p>John Stuart Mill, in an essay on Jeremy
Bentham, pointed out that the secret of the latter’s
strength and originality of thought lay in
his method, which “may be shortly described as
the method of detail; of treating wholes by separating
them into their parts, abstractions by
resolving them into things,—classes and generalities
by dis­tin­guish­ing them into the individuals
of which they are made up; and breaking
every question into pieces before attempting
to solve it.” The method was not absolutely
original with Bentham, but “whatever originality
there was in the method, in the subjects he
applied it to, and in the rigidity with which he
adhered to it, there was the greatest.”</p>

<p>The sys­tem­at­ic thinker is careful of the manner
in which he marshals his difficulties. He
knows that certain problems should properly
be considered before certain others, and he
saves himself labor and sometimes error by
considering them in that order. Before asking
himself how Government should cure a given
social evil, he first asks whether it is the duty
or even the right of the State to attend to that
par­tic­u­lar evil at all. In other words, before
asking what the State should do in any par­tic­u­lar
case, he considers first what the proper
sphere of government is. It must be admitted
that a previous question often cannot be discovered
until one has actually attempted the
solution of a problem. In the foregoing instance,
it would be difficult to determine the
proper sphere of government by any other
method than a con­si­der­a­tion of par­tic­u­lar cases
where government interference suggests itself.</p>

<p>In fact, it is only by deep reflection on a subject
that we come to realize most of the problems
involved. You walk along the road with
your friend the botanist and he stops to pick
what looks to you to be a common wild flower.
“Hm,” he muses, “I wonder how that got in
this part of the country?” Now that is no
problem to you, simply because you do not happen
to know why that par­tic­u­lar flower should
<i>not</i> be there—and what men do not know about
they take for granted. Knowledge furnishes
problems, and the discovery of problems itself
constitutes an in­tel­lec­tual advance.</p>

<p>Whenever you are thrashing out a subject,
write down every problem, difficulty and objection
that occurs to you. When you get what
you consider a satisfactory solution, see
whether or not it answers all of them.</p>

<p>I have stated that method is essential to good
thinking. I have given rules and examples of
methodic thinking. But I do not want to create
a false impression. If a man has not within
him the materials of a thinker, no amount of
method can make him one. Half the thinking
process, as pointed out, depends on the occurrence
of sug­ges­tions. The occurrence of sug­ges­tions
depends on how ideas are associated in
a man’s mind. While this depends to some extent
on the education and the whole past life and
environment of the individual, it depends far
more on inborn mental qualities. All method
can do is to awaken the most fruitful associations
of ideas already in mind. Hence the more
methods we adopt—the greater the number of
views we take of any problem—the more solutions
will suggest themselves.</p>

<p>There is one further reason why we should
take as many different viewpoints as possible.
In our example of the inheritance of acquired
char­ac­ter­is­tics in animals, if we had been sure
that the results of our deductive reasoning were
correct, it would have been a sinful waste of
time to experiment. But when we attack a
problem by several methods we can compare the
results from each. If these results agree we
have good evidence that our solution is correct.
But if we have adopted quite a number of viewpoints,
and have not let the results of one influence
those of the next, they are almost certain
to be at variance. This means that we have
erred in applying one or several methods. How
are we to find which of the methods it was, and
how are we to prevent such errors?</p>

<p>This is the subject of our next chapter.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section" id="p051">
<h2 class="h2herein">III <span class="hsmall">
A FEW CAUTIONS</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">Thus far we have con­sidered only pos­i­tive
and con­struc­tive think­ing, and means for
ob­tain­ing relevant sug­ges­tions. We have had
almost nothing to do with cautions, means for
avoiding fallacy and error, and means for testing
the truth and value of sug­ges­tions. Most
writers who have discussed thinking have dwelt
so much on the negative aspect—so much on
what we should not do—and have so slighted the
question of what we should do, that I have perhaps
been led to adopt this order, more from a
feeling of revolt than because it is logically better.
But I believe I have logic on my side.
Constructive methods make thinking “go”;
cautions steer it in the right path. An auto­mo­bile
with­out a steer­ing gear is almost as useless
as one without a motor. But an auto­mo­bile
can go without being steered, whereas it cannot
be steered unless it is going.</p>

<p>But while with automobiles we can clearly
divide moving from steering, we cannot do this
with thinking. The two processes are so inextricably
bound up, that we cannot engage in one
without engaging in the other; we cannot even
speak of one without implying the other. I
have divided them for convenience of exposition.
But in the last chapter we were forced
to deal slightly with cautions, and here we shall
have to consider constructive methods to some
extent.</p>

<p>A case in point is clas­si­fi­ca­tion. In taking
this up from a constructive standpoint, I remarked
that all clas­si­fi­ca­tions ought to be logical.
But I did not say what I meant by logical,
nor did I tell how a logical clas­si­fi­ca­tion could
be secured. The two most prominent errors
made in classifying are (1) not making clas­si­fi­ca­tions
mutually exclusive, (2) not making them
cover all the objects or phenomena supposed to
be classified.</p>

<p>The first error is the less common, for though
occurring among all thinkers, it is comparatively
infrequent among those who proceed with
caution. It is, moreover, more easily
discovered than the second. Consider the clas­si­fi­ca­tion
of constructive methods into comparison,
observation, and experiment. It is apparent
that these methods overlap. We cannot compare
without observing, much of our observation
involves comparison, when we experiment we
must of course observe the results obtained, and
the results are usually always compared. All
three methods could be classed under observation.
It is well to remember, however, that the
first clas­si­fi­ca­tion may be useful—even more so
than one strictly logical, and that the nature of
a subject will often make impracticable, divisions
which do not overlap in some degree.</p>

<p>The second error—that of not making a clas­si­fi­ca­tion
cover all the objects or phenomena
it is supposed to cover—is not so easy to detect.
It is one to which the greatest philosophers have
been heir. Some of our Socialist friends say
there are but two kinds of people: capitalists
and laborers, “the people who live on others and
the people who are lived on.” They overlook
that class of farmers who own a little piece of
land and do their own tilling. Even if they insist
that such a class “is rapidly becoming
extinct,” the fact remains that it is still with us
and must be taken into account.</p>

<p>All clas­si­fi­ca­tions are made with a certain
number of facts in mind, and fortunate is he
who happens to have just the right facts. We
cannot hold many facts in mind at once, and we
often generalize upon thousands of things by
taking a supposedly representative dozen. To
avoid error all we can do is to keep constantly
on the lookout for examples, especially those
which apparently will not fit into our gen­er­al­i­za­tion.
If they go in without straining anything,
our clas­si­fi­ca­tion receives added warrant. But
sometimes you will find that where you have
three classes a new fact will necessitate a fourth,
and that often it will overturn your whole beautiful
structure.</p>

<p>There is another phase of thinking, which
while chiefly cautionary, is also in part constructive.
We have so often been warned to “avoid
the treachery of words” and to “define all our
terms” that a repetition of the advice seems unnecessary.
But we cannot overlook the excellent
counsel of Blaise Pascal. He urges that
we not only define our terms, but that whenever
we use them we mentally substitute the definition.
However, this needs to be qualified. If
every time we used a term we stopped to substitute
its definition, our thought might be
exact but would hardly move forward very rapidly.
It will usually be sufficient simply to substitute
the definition a few times, for after doing
this we shall gradually come to know exactly
what we mean by a term, and further substitution
would merely waste time. Of course, all
this need be applied only to terms new, technical
or equivocal; or those used in a mooted proposition.</p>

<p>I have spoken of analogy as a constructive
method. This, however, should be used only
for sug­ges­tion, for it is most dangerous. Often
we use an analogy and are quite unaware of it.
Thus many social and political thinkers have
called society an “organism,” and have proceeded
to deal with it as if it were a large animal.
They have thought not in terms of the
actual phenomena under con­si­der­a­tion, but in
terms of the analogy. In so far as the terms
of the analogy were more concrete than those
of the phenomena, their thinking has been made
easier. But no analogy will ever hold good
throughout, and consequently these thinkers
have often fallen into error.</p>

<p>The quickest way to detect error in analogy
is to carry it out as far as it will go—and further.
Every analogy will break down somewhere.
Any analogy if carried out far enough
becomes absurd. We are most likely to err
when we carry an analogy too far, but not to
the point where the absurdity is apparent.
Take the analogy employed in our first chapter,
comparing thinking and a ship. For the sake
of the image I shall make this a motor-boat.
We might carry this out further. We might
compare the effect on the mind of books and
experience to the fuel used for the engine. The
brain, transforming outward experience into
thought, might be paralleled with a carburetor
transforming fuel into usable form. An idea
may be compared to a spark. All this is very
fascinating. It may even lead to sug­ges­tions
of real value. But it is bound soon or late to
develop into the ludicrous. The analogy in
question, however, does not need to be developed
to be confuted. For unless a boat has a
propeller and a rudder, its engine is useless. A
mind is capable of attaining truth without even
being aware of the existence of a science of
thinking or of logic.</p>

<p>Another way to find whether an analogy is
fallacious is to see whether you can discover a
counter analogy. Surely this is the most effective
practice in refuting analogy in argument.
This suggests the case of the man who had a
ticket from New York to Chicago, and tried to
use it from Chicago to New York. The railroad
refused to accept it, whereupon the man brought
suit. The lawyer for the defendant, in the heat
of the debate, said, “Why, a man might just as
well pay for a barrel of potatoes and then demand
a barrel of apples!” Whereupon the attorney
for the plaintiff replied, “It would be
rather like a grocer selling a man a barrel of
potatoes and then trying to compel him to eat
them from the top down, refusing to allow him to
turn the barrel upside down and begin eating
them from the bottom up.” It is best to avoid
analogy except for purposes of sug­ges­tion, or
as a rhetorical device for explaining an idea already
arrived at by other means.</p>

<p>I have been forced to defend my advice to
take as many viewpoints as possible, by pointing
out that the conclusions obtained from these
viewpoints might disagree; in fact would be almost
sure to disagree. Of course, this disagreement
might be avoided if we allowed the conclusions
reached by one method or viewpoint to
influence our conclusions in another. But if we
do this we give our problem more shallow treatment,
and we are not so sure of a result when
we get it. When a mathematician adds a
column of figures from the top down, he confirms
by re-adding from the bottom up. He knows
that if he added in the same manner the second
time he would be liable to fall into the same errors.
And in thinking, when we leave one
method and take up another, we should try to
forget entirely the first conclusion and begin on
the problem as if we had never taken it up before.
After we have taken up all the applicable
methods, then, and then only, should we begin
to compare conclusions.</p>

<p>Time forbids doing this with all problems.
Time forbids even attacking all problems from
different points of view. But there are some
problems where this unquestionably ought to be
done. The problem of whether or not char­ac­ter­is­tics
acquired during the life time of one
individual may be inherited by his offspring, if
dealt with at all, is too important to be left to
the a priori method alone. This problem asks
whether the children of educated parents will
necessarily be innately superior to the children
of uneducated parents; it asks whether the man
of today is superior to the ancient Greek, or
even the present day savage; or, assuming that
the negro race is inferior to the white race, it
asks whether generations of education will
bring it to the white race level or leave it unchanged;
it asks whether the hope of improving
the human race lies in education or eugenics.
No question can be more important than this in
its practical bearings. The answer to it will
profoundly influence our opinions in education,
psychology, ethics, economics, political science—even
philosophy and metaphysics. The answer
we obtain to this question from deductive
reasoning, no matter how unanswerable or
conclusive it may seem, should be checked up by
nothing short of the most thoroughgoing experiment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the experiments needed for
this par­tic­u­lar question cannot be carried on by
the layman. It is equally to be regretted that
scientists have been none too thorough in carrying
them out themselves. But we should remember
that any result we arrive at should be
subject to revision, and that if we take up this
problem at all, we should at least make it our
duty to read about and criticise all the experiments
that come to our notice.</p>

<p>A question has perhaps just occurred to the
reader. If the deductive method is to be
checked up by experiment, and the results of
the experiment are always to be taken, why not
experiment first, and omit theory altogether?</p>

<p>Leaving aside the fact that theory is the best
guide for experiment—that were it not for
theory and the problems and hypotheses that
come out of it, we would not know the points we
wanted to verify, and hence would experiment
aimlessly—a more serious objection is that experiment
is seldom if ever perfect, for it nearly
always involves some unverified assumption. I
have referred to empirical observation and experiment
as two different methods. But the
difference is mainly, if not solely, one of degree.
If we experimented to find out whether acquired
char­ac­ter­is­tics were inherited, it is obvious
that our experiments would have to be confined
to animals. If we found, let us say, that
no acquired char­ac­ter­is­tic was ever transmitted
to offspring, we could not say that this would
be equally true of man, but would be justified in
concluding only that the acquired char­ac­ter­is­tics
of <i>animals</i> are not transmitted to descendants.
Nay, we could not go even this far. We
would have to confine ourselves to the statement
that certain acquired char­ac­ter­is­tics of the few
score animals we had experimented upon were
not transmissible. But even this statement
would involve assumption. We could say only
that certain acquired char­ac­ter­is­tics of the few
score animals we had experimented upon had
not been transmitted in these par­tic­u­lar instances.
We would have to limit ourselves to a
bare statement of fact; we could draw no conclusion
whatever. But if we had attacked this
problem from the deductive standpoint, and had
concluded that owing to certain conditions holding
alike in all animals and in man, acquired
char­ac­ter­is­tics <i>could not possibly</i> be transmitted,
we would have sufficient ground for deriving
from our experiments a broad gen­er­al­i­za­tion.</p>

<p>Experiment and deduction are not the only
methods which can be checked up against each
other. We can do likewise with the comparative
and the experimental, the historical and the
theoretical—in fact, all viewpoints applicable
to any one problem.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>When you encounter a question about which
there is a controversy, and where the adherents
of both sides nearly equal each other in number
and in­tel­lec­tual status, you may be almost certain
that each side has caught sight of some
truth, but that neither has seen the whole truth;
and you should endeavor to unite both sides by
a broader and deeper solution. A classic philosophical
example of this method is Herbert
Spencer’s attempt to reconcile science and
religion, and his effort to unite the “intuitional”
and “experiential” schools of thought. The
intuitionists maintained that the mind had from
birth intuitions by which it knew certain truths
in­de­pen­dently of experience. Such truths as
the axiom that a straight line is the shortest distance
between two points, or that it is morally
wrong to do certain acts, were regarded as
among these intuitions. The “empiricists” or
“sensa­tion­alists,” on the other hand, maintained
that all our knowledge—even of such a fact, for
instance, as that two and two are four, where
we cannot conceive otherwise—is learned solely
from the individual’s experience, taken in its
broadest sense. Herbert Spencer thought he
recognized some truth in both these doctrines,
and came forward with the theory that there
are certain truths which are intuitions so far as
the individual is concerned, but that these intuitions
have been inherited from our ancestors,
were originally built up through the ages, and
represent the accumulated experience of the
race. Whatever may be thought of Spencer’s
success in this case, the value of the method
itself is undoubted. It was frequently used by
Kant, Hegel, Fichte and other German philosophers.</p>

<p>I have remarked that it is almost possible to
sum up the entire process of thinking as the occurrence
of sug­ges­tions for the solution of difficulties
and the testing out of those sug­ges­tions.
The constructive methods discussed were called
means for making good sug­ges­tions occur to us.
From this standpoint the cautions with which
we have just been dealing may be considered as
tests of sug­ges­tions.</p>

<p>Let us refer back to the analysis of thinking
given in the case of the man who discovered
footprints on the beach. Even there, in order
to give any adequate idea of his thought process,
I was obliged to show that for various reasons
he rejected certain suggested solutions. But
this negative method could be more fully developed.
Because the man rejected a certain
solution, it does not follow that it was necessarily
wrong. Suppose the final sug­ges­tion—that
the unknown had been on the island all the
time—were to have been tested out, and that certain
further facts were discovered which tended
to disprove it; the man might find it necessary
to look for still another solution. But suppose
this were not forthcoming, suppose that all the
possibilities had been exhausted. It would be
necessary to return to some of the original
sug­ges­tions. He would have to see whether an
error had been made in testing them. In rejecting
the sug­ges­tion of a small boat he may
have overestimated the distance of this island
from other land. He may have underestimated
the difficulties that a man in a small boat is
capable of surmounting. In rejecting the sup­po­si­tion
of a ship, he may have erred in his
judgment of the time the footprints had been on
the beach, or of the time it would take a large
vessel to get out of sight.</p>

<p>What is essential is that all sug­ges­tions be
tested out, either by memory, observation or
experiment, in all their implications, and that
the tendency be resisted to accept the first solution
that suggests itself. For the uncritical
thinker will always jump at the first sug­ges­tion,
unless an objection actually forces itself into
view. Remaining in a state of doubt is unpleasant.
The longer the doubt remains the
more unpleasant it becomes. But the man who
is willing to accept this unpleasantness, the
man who is willing carefully to observe, or experiment
if need be, to test the validity of his
sug­ges­tions, will finally arrive at a solution
much deeper, and one which will give him far
more satisfaction, than the superficial answer
obtained by the man of careless habits of
thought.</p>

<p>Thomas A. Edison says he always rejects an
easy solution of any problem and looks for
something difficult. But the inventor has one
great advantage over any other kind of thinker.
He can test his conclusion in a tangible way.
If his device works, his thinking was right; if
his device doesn’t work, his thinking was wrong.
But the philosopher, the scientist, the social reformer,
has no such satisfactory test. His
only satisfaction is the feeling that his results
harmonize with all his experience. The more
critical he has been in arriving at those results,
the more deep and permanent will be that feeling,
the more valuable will be his thoughts to
himself and to the world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Even in the first chapter I intimated that logic
would constitute a part of the science of thinking.
I intimated, moreover, that it would constitute
almost the whole of what may be called
the negative side of thinking—those rules which
serve to steer thought aright. Though cautionary,
the advice given in this chapter is not
usually given in books on logic. But though I
cannot overemphasize the importance of a
knowledge of logic, I cannot deal with it here.
The science can receive justice only in a book
devoted entirely to it.</p>

<p>If he has not already done so the would-be
thinker should study a work on logic, for unless
the present book is supplemented by some
treatise on that science it cannot be regarded as
complete.</p>

<p>In order not to confuse the reader I shall recommend
only one book. In order to encourage
him I shall recom­mend a small book, one not
so deep as to be in­com­pre­hen­si­ble or re­pulsive
to the beginner, but at the same time one which
is recognized as a standard treatise:—<i>Elementary
Lessons in Logic</i>, by Stanley Jevons.</p>

<h2 class="h2herein">IV <span class="hsmall">
CONCENTRATION</span></h2>

<p class="pepigraph">
What is the hardest task in the world? To
think.—<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">We
have been dealing with the subject of
thinking. We have considered it from
both a positive and negative side. But while
we have devoted our attention to thinking, we
have neglected the thinker. In more scientific
terms, we have treated thought from the logical
side; we are now to treat it from the psy­cho­log­i­cal.</p>

<p>Few people will admit specific faults in themselves
of any kind, especially if these happen
to be in­tel­lec­tual. But almost any man is willing
to confess that he cannot always “con­cen­trate”
when he wants to, in fact, that he is one
of the countless victims of “mind wandering.”</p>

<p>Most of us imagine we know just what we
mean by both these terms. But if we are to
judge by most of what has been written, no two
terms are more misconceived. Before trying to
find the best means of con­cen­trating, we must
first find just what we mean by con­cen­tration.</p>

<p>In a previous chapter I said that sug­ges­tions
for solutions “occurred.” I did not say how
or why. To discover this we must refer to the
famous psy­cho­log­i­cal principle of association.</p>

<p>Any train of thought is made possible by
previous connections of ideas in our minds.
While a girl sits at her window a parade passes
along a nearby street. The band is playing, and
ere the tune is completed the band has gone so
far that the music is no longer audible. But
the tune still goes along in her mind, and she
completes it herself. It suggests a dance she
had been to where it was played, and this suggests
that she danced the two-step to it. The
two-step suggests the more modern one-step,
and this leads her to compare the familiar dancing
of to-day with the distant and respectful
minuet.</p>

<p>This is an example of a random train of ideas.
It is that loose “thinking” referred to in our
first chapter. But even this is made possible
only by the connection of ideas in our mind at
some previous period. No thought can enter
our minds unless it is associated in some way
with the previous thought. Psychologists have
traditionally classified associations into four
kinds: association by succession, by contiguity,
by similarity and by contrast. The example
just given involves all four. Association by
succession means that when two ideas or impressions
of objects have entered the mind in
succession, the second is likely to be suggested
whenever the first is thought of. A tune consists
in a succession of notes, and when the first
notes are brought to mind, as by a passing
band, the rest will follow—sometimes in spite of
ourselves. Association by contiguity means
that when two objects or ideas have been in con­scious­ness
together, one is always likely to suggest
the other thereafter. This was the case
with the music and the dance, or the music and
the two-step. Association by similarity occurs
when two ideas resemble each other in some par­tic­u­lar.
They need not have occurred together
at any past time, nor after each other. The
fact that they have a common element suffices to
bring up one idea when the other is in mind:
thus the two-step suggested the one-step. Association
by contrast needs no explanation. It
is exemplified when the idea of present-day
dancing brings up the idea of distant dancing.</p>

<p>Any attempt to show <i>why</i> the mind acts in
this way, any explanation of the way in which
the different kinds of association are made possible,
would bring us into physiological psychology,
would involve a study of the brain and the
nervous system. For our purposes it is sufficient
to keep in mind that such associations do
take place. Without them no idea can occur.
Without them thought is impossible.</p>

<p>The bearing of all this on con­cen­tration has
yet to be made plain. We must remember that
every idea has more than one associate; in fact
that each idea generally has a cluster of possible
associates. Instead of suggesting the
minuet, the one-step may have made the fox trot
or the three-step occur to the young lady. It
may have made her think of a young man with
whom she danced it, or the trouble she had in
learning it. Each of these sug­ges­tions, in turn,
would also have potential connections with a
cluster of ideas. When we are thinking at random—when
we are day dreaming, as in the example
given—the strongest association, or the
first to be aroused, is the one we dwell upon.
But when we are thinking with a purpose, in a
word, when we are reasoning, we reject all associations
which have no bearing on our purpose,
and select only those which serve it.</p>

<p>Concentration does not, as popularly supposed,
mean keeping the mind fastened on one
object or idea or in one place. It consists in
having a problem or purpose constantly before
one. It means keeping our thought moving
toward one desired end.</p>

<p>Concentration is often regarded as intense
or focused attention. But the fact is that all
attention is focused attention. Psychologists
are fairly well agreed that we can attend to only
one thing at a time. Mind wandering, and so-called
distributed attention, is really attention
directed first to one thing, then to another, then
to another; or first to one thing, then to another,
and then back again to the original object, resting
but a few moments on each idea.</p>

<p>Concentration may best be defined as prolonged
or sustained attention. It means keeping
the mind on one subject or problem for a
relatively long period, or at least continually
reverting to some problem whenever one’s
thoughts momentarily leave it.</p>

<p>Having decided just what we mean by con­cen­tration,
our next step is to inquire whether
con­cen­tration is worth while. The reader may
smile at this question or he may be shocked,
according to his temperament. But if most
men were so convinced that con­cen­tration is
such an unquestionable virtue, they would practice
it a little more. At least they would make
greater efforts to practice it than they do at
present.</p>

<p>The truth is that con­cen­tration, <i>per se</i>, is of
little value. The value of con­cen­tra­tion depends
almost entirely on the subject con­cen­trated
on. Almost any one will agree that even
were a man to allow his mind to dwell now on
one important problem and now on another,
without stopping a very appreciable time at any,
he might nevertheless be improving his time far
more than a man who con­cen­trat­ed con­tinually
on some in­sig­nif­i­cant and in­con­se­quen­tial question.</p>

<p>But of course this is not really an argument
against con­cen­tration. It has no application
when you con­cen­trate on the proper subject.
For if you start to con­cen­trate on some question
which you have decided is really important, you
should keep at it, allowing no deviation. It
may be that during the course of your thought
associations will be aroused which will suggest
or bear upon important problems, problems
more important perhaps than the one you originally
started to con­cen­trate on. But if you
immediately abandoned every problem you
started to think of, whenever you came across
one which you imagined was just as important,
you would probably never really solve any big
question.</p>

<p>Our attention is guided by interest. If a man
merely allows his thoughts to flow at random,
thinking only of those things which spontaneously
arouse his interest, he may or may
not attend to things worth thinking about. All
will depend upon the path in which his natural
interests run. But the point is that if the
subject he thinks about is valuable, it will be so only
by accident; whether or not his thinking is useful
will depend upon mere chance. If however
he consciously chooses a subject—chooses it because
he believes it to be important—then his
thinking will be worth while.</p>

<p>But there is another reason why con­cen­tration
is necessary. Suppose a man started to
put up a barbed wire fence, got as far as driving
in all the posts, then lost interest in the
fences and decided to grow potatoes in his field,
plowed up the ground, lost interest in the field
and neglected to plant the seeds; decided to
paint his house, got the porch done, lost interest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
That man might work as hard as
any other man, but he would never get anything
done. So with the mind wanderer and
the con­cen­trator. The mind wanderer thinks
of a problem, loses interest, and abandons it.
The con­cen­trator sticks to it until it is solved.</p>

<p>Much of our mind wandering is due to the fact
that we are not fully convinced of the importance
of the problem being attacked, or that
we regard other problems or ideas as more important.
Concentration consists in devoting
one’s mind to the solution of one problem. During
our train of thought associations bring up
new ideas or suggest problems which do not
bear on the question at hand. Now when we
wander, when we follow up these irrelevant ideas
or suggested problems, or when we happen to
glance at something or hear something and begin
to think of that, we do so because of a half-conscious
belief that the new idea, problem or
fact needs attending to, is important. I have
already pointed out that if this new idea is important
it will be so only by accident. If we
were consciously to ask ourselves whether any
of these irrelevant problems were as important
as the one we were con­cen­trating on, or even
important at all, we would find, nine times out
of ten, that they were not.</p>

<p>Therefore before beginning to con­cen­trate
you should assure yourself that the problem you
are about to attack is one worth solving, or at
least devoting a certain time to. And during
that time you should think only of that problem,
and unhesitatingly throw out all irrelevant sug­ges­tions
coming either from your course of
thought or from external sights and sounds.</p>

<p>One qualification is necessary. Sometimes
an irrelevant sug­ges­tion occurs which is nevertheless
really important and worth developing.
As this might be forgotten, and as it might
never occur again, it would be poor counsel indeed
to ask that it be thrown aside forever.
The best move in such a case would be to make
written note of the sug­ges­tion or problem, so
that it could be referred to at some future time.
Having written the idea, you will have it off
your mind, and will be able to continue your line
of thought without perturbation.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that a great aid to con­cen­tration
is writing one’s thoughts. It must
be admitted that this certainly helps one to keep
much closer to a subject. Ordinarily we wander
without being aware of it, and bring our
minds back to a subject only after sudden intermittent
realizations that we have gone astray.
When we write our thoughts, however, we
doubly secure ourselves against mind wandering.
All writing requires a certain effort, and
this alone is sufficient to keep most of us from
writing irrelevant thoughts, or anything not
directly bearing upon the subject in hand.
When we write, too, we capture our thoughts in
tangible symbols; we make them less elusive
than in their original form. Finally, we keep
our entire past train of thought in view. Like
an oarsman, who cannot look ahead, but guides
himself by the objects he is constantly leaving
further behind, we keep to our original course
of thought by a survey of the ideas already written.</p>

<p>In spite of these great advantages, writing
has certain serious handicaps as a practical
method for con­cen­trating. First among these
is its slowness. Thoughts flash through our
minds much faster than we can write them.
We either lose many ideas by the wayside, or
fail to go as far in our subject as we otherwise
would. Another disadvantage is that we are
forced to give part of our attention to the
physical act of writing, and thus cannot con­cen­trate
entirely on our subject.</p>

<p>There are two methods of writing comparatively
free of at least one of these handicaps.
Both shorthand and typewriting, if mastered to
any degree, are much faster than ordinary
writing. This is especially true, of course, of
shorthand. But even with a good stenographer
shorthand has serious defects. Unless one is
quite expert it requires even more attention than
longhand, and at that is often unable to keep
pace with thought. Typewriting requires almost
no attention from a touch operator, but it
too is open to the charge of slowness, coming
in this respect about midway between short and
longhand.</p>

<p>But to those so unfortunate as not to know
either shorthand or typewriting the necessity
for still another method is evident. Indeed,
even those acquainted with these two arts cannot
always use them. If every time we were
to think we had to have with us a typewriter,
or even a pencil and note-book, we would not
engage in any too much reflection.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is one method superior to
any yet named, which requires no study before
its application, and no paraphernalia during it.
It consists in simply talking your thoughts as
you think them. One who has not tried this can
have no idea of its effect. It possesses almost
all the advantages of writing. You cannot
wander without realizing the fact immediately.
It makes your thinking much less vague than
if you thought silently, increases your vocabulary,
always keeps pace with your ideas, and requires
practically no attention.</p>

<p>It may be objected that silent thinking itself
is put in unspoken words. But this is not true.
Part of silent thinking consists of unspoken
words, but part of it consists of images, concepts
and attitudes which pass through our
minds and which we do not take the trouble to
name. In silent thinking, too, there are also
what appear to be occasional dead stops. All
these processes drift into each other indefinably
and are unrecognizable. When we talk we
realize whether our images or concepts are
vague or definite by our ability to name them,
and we realize when our thought comes to a
“dead stop” by the fact that we miss the sound
of our own voice.</p>

<p>Another practice can be used with talking.
The degree of con­cen­tration we give to any subject
depends upon the degree of natural interest
we take in it. Mind wandering comes because
we are also interested in other subjects. No
matter how slight our interest in a thing, we
would always con­cen­trate on it if we were interested
in nothing else. To secure sustained
attention, then, we should (1) stimulate or increase
interest in problems we want to con­cen­trate
on, (2) decrease or remove temporarily
any interest in the things we do not want to
think about. Men often complain that noises
distract their attention. While not impossible,
it is inconvenient and unpleasant to shut off our
ears. But men are far more distracted by
sights than they are by sounds. And they
never think of merely shutting their eyes. The
next time you attempt to con­cen­trate—silently
or by talking—try shutting your eyes and see
whether or not you are helped.</p>

<p>Talking has one disadvantage—it cannot always
be used. To practice it, you must either
lock yourself up in your room, or sit alone in
a forest or field, or walk along unfrequented
streets and by-ways. You can by no means
allow any one to hear or see you talking to yourself.
If you are caught doing this some asinine
idiot is sure to mistake you for one.</p>

<p>We are brought back again, then, to the necessity
of occasionally thinking in silence. There
is one other reason why we shall sometimes
need to do this. Thoughts of certain kinds are
so elusive that to attempt to articulate them
is to scare them away, as a fish is scared by the
slightest ripple. When these thoughts are in
embryo, even the infinitesimal attention required
for talking cannot be spared. But later,
as they take more definite and coherent form,
they can and should be put into words, for otherwise
they will be incommunicable and useless.</p>

<p>No definite rule can be laid down, however, as
to what should be spoken and what thought of
silently. This depends to a large extent upon
the individual thinker. Some will probably
find that talking helps them in almost all their
thinking, others that it is often an actual
hindrance. The same is true of closing one’s
eyes. If you do not know which is better for
you, find out by experiment.</p>

<p>At those times when you suddenly catch yourself
wandering, it would be a good plan to stop
occasionally and trace back your train of
thought to the point where it left its original
direction. In this way you would get some valuable
insight into the <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> of mind
wandering; you would be helped in recognizing
its appearance sooner the next time it occurred.</p>

<p>Whenever a person is left alone for a short
time, with no one to talk to and no “reading
matter”; when for instance, he is standing at
a station waiting for his train, or sitting at a
restaurant table waiting for his order, or hanging
on a subway strap when he has forgotten
to buy a newspaper, his “thoughts” tend to run
along the tracks they have habitually taken. If
a young man usually allows a popular tune to
float through his head, that will be most likely
to happen; if he usually thinks of that young
lady, he will most likely think of her then; if he
has often imagined himself as some great political
orator making a speech amid the plaudits
of the multitude, he is likely to see a mental picture
of himself swinging his arms, waving flags
and gulping water.</p>

<p>The only way a man can put a stop to such
pleasant but uneducative roamings, is to snap
off his train of day dreaming the first moment
he becomes aware of it, and to address his mind
to some useful serious subject. His thoughts
will be almost sure to leak away again. They
may do this as often as fifteen times in half an
hour. But the second he becomes aware of it
he should dam up the stream and send his
thoughts along the channel he has laid out for
them. If he has never done this he will find
the effort great. But if he merely resolves now
that the next time his mind wanders he will stop
it in this manner, his resolve will tend to make
itself felt. If he succeeds in following this
practice once it will be much easier a second
time. Every time he does this it will become
increasingly easy, until he will have arrived at
the point where his control over his thoughts
will be almost absolute. Not only will it be increasingly
easy for him to turn his mind to serious
subjects. It will become constantly more
pleasurable. Frivolous and petty trains of
thought will become more and more intolerable.</p>

<p>This whole idea of forcing our thought has
been questioned by no less a thinker than Herbert
Spencer. Let us hear what he has to say
regarding his own practice:</p>

<p>“It has never been my way to set before myself
a problem and puzzle out an answer. The
conclusions at which I have from time to time
arrived, have not been arrived at as solutions of
questions raised; but have been arrived at unawares—each
as the ultimate outcome of a body
of thoughts which slowly grew from a germ.
Some direct observation, or some fact met with
in reading, would dwell with me: apparently
because I had a sense of its significance. It was
not that there arose a distinct con­scious­ness of
its general meaning; but rather that there was
a kind of instinctive interest in those facts
which have general meanings. For example,
the detailed structure of this or that species of
mammal, though I might willingly read about it,
would leave little impression; but when I met
with the statement that, almost without exception,
mammals, even as unlike as the whale and
the giraffe, have seven cervical vertebræ, this
would strike me and be remembered as suggestive.
Apt as I thus was to lay hold of cardinal
truths, it would happen occasionally that one,
most likely brought to mind by an illustration,
and gaining from the illustration fresh dis­tinc­tive­ness,
would be contemplated by me for a
while, and its bearings observed. A week afterwards,
possibly, the matter would be
remembered; and with further thought about it, might
occur a recognition of some wider application
than I had before perceived: new instances being
aggregated with those already noted.
Again after an interval, perhaps of a month,
perhaps of half a year, something would remind
me of that which I had before remarked; and
mentally running over the facts might be followed
by some further extension of the idea.
When accumulation of instances had given body
to a gen­er­al­i­za­tion, reflexion would reduce the
vague conception at first framed to a more
definite conception; and perhaps difficulties or
anomalies passed over for a while, but eventually
forcing themselves on attention, might
cause a needful qualification and a truer shaping
of the thought. Eventually the growing
gen­er­al­i­za­tion, thus far inductive, might take
a deductive form: being all at once recognized
as a necessary consequence of some physical
principle—some established law. And thus, little
by little, in unobtrusive ways, without
conscious intention or appreciable effort, there
would grow up a coherent and organized theory.
Habitually the process was one of slow unforced
development, often extending over years; and
the thinking done went on in this gradual, almost
spontaneous way, without
strain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn6" id="fnanc6">6</a></p>

<p>But compare this method with that of John
Stuart Mill; who speaks of “the mental habit to
which I attribute all that I have ever done, or
ever shall do, in speculation; that of never
abandoning a puzzle, but again and again returning
to it until it was cleared up; never allowing
obscure corners of a subject to remain
unexplored because they did not appear important;
never thinking that I perfectly understood
any part of a subject until I understood
the whole.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn7" id="fnanc7">7</a> Mill’s method was, in short,
“that of conscious and vehement effort directed
towards the end he had in view. He solved his
problems by laborious application and study.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn8" id="fnanc8">8</a></p>

<p>William Minto writes of Adam Smith: “His
in­tel­lec­tual proceedings were calm, patient, and
regular: he mastered a subject slowly and cir­cum­spect­ly,
and carried his principles with
steady tenacity through multitudes of details
that would have checked many men of greater
mental vigor un­en­dowed with the same in­vin­ci­ble
per­sis­tence.”</p>

<p>With such thinkers differing so markedly in
their methods, the ordinary man is left bewildered.
He may indeed decide that effort or no
effort makes little difference. Let us, however,
look to the psychology of the question, and see
whether we can find any guiding principle.</p>

<p>Spencer, defending his method, says: “A
solution reached in the way described, is more
likely to be true than one reached in pursuance
of a de­ter­mined effort to find a solution. The
de­ter­mined effort causes perversion of thought.
When endeavoring to recol­lect some name or
thing which has been for­got­ten, it frequently
happens that the name or thing sought will not
arise in con­scious­ness; but when attention is relaxed,
the missing name or thing often suggests
itself. While thought continues to be forced
down certain wrong turnings which had originally
been taken, the search is vain; but with the
cessation of strain the true association of ideas
has an op­por­tunity of asserting itself. And,
similarly, it may be that while an effort to
arrive forthwith at some answer to a problem,
acts as a distorting factor in con­scious­ness and
causes error, a quiet contemplation of the problem
from time to time, allows those proclivities
of thought which have probably been caused unawares
by experiences, to make themselves felt,
and to guide the mind to the right conclusion.”</p>

<p>Spencer’s first argument, that an effort to
recollect something is often without results,
while the thing is remembered later when we
are not trying to think of it, is true as to fact.
But it does not show that the effort was unfruitful.
As pointed out in the discussion of
association, one idea is associated with not only
one other idea but with an entire group. This
may give a possible explanation of why it is so
often difficult to recollect anything when we
make a determined effort. The attempt partly
arouses a whole cluster of ideas, each of which
tends to return, but is prevented from doing so
by all the others. It is analogous to a crowd of
people all struggling to get through a narrow
doorway. They cause such a jam that for a
time no one succeeds. When the pushing and
jostling cease one person at a time is able to
pass through. When effort is abandoned, probably
all but one of the associates become dormant,
and this one slides into con­scious­ness at
the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>Whether or not this explanation is true, it is
a fact that though an effort may not produce results
at the time, still if it had not been made,
the associate which finally comes to mind would
probably never have occurred at all. The
reader has possibly found that when learning
some skilled movement, such as bicycle riding,
skating or swimming, his first attempts seemed
without result, but after an interval of a week or
a month, when trying again, he suddenly discovered
that he could do what he wanted from
the very start. Surely no one would contend
that this could happen without the previous effort!</p>

<p>I must also question Spencer’s remark that
“with the cessation of strain the true association
of ideas has an opportunity of asserting itself.”
The brain has no hidden mechanism by
which it can separate the true from the false.
To be sure, if we use no effort the most usual
and strongest associations will be more likely
to assert themselves, and it may be that often
these will have more warrant than unusual and
weaker associations. Outside of this, there is
no superiority.</p>

<p>But the main reason why we cannot follow the
method of Herbert Spencer is that we are not
all Herbert Spencers. His thought naturally
tended to serious and useful channels. Consequently
he did not have to force it there. If the
reader is one of those rare and fortunate beings
whose thoughts run only to useful subjects,
and who always con­cen­trate from pure spontaneous
interest, I sincerely advise him not to
force himself. And if such a being happens to
be reading the present chapter I assure him he
is criminally wasting his time, and that he
should drop the book or turn to the next chapter
with all possible haste. But if the reader numbers
himself with the miserable majority whose
minds are ever running away with them, he will
find it necessary to use effort in thinking—at
least for a while.</p>

<p>One remark of Spencer is undoubtedly true.
This is “that an effort to arrive forthwith at
some answer to a problem, acts as a distorting
factor in con­scious­ness and causes error.”
And here, strange to say, his practice is in substantial
agreement with the apparently opposite
method of John Stuart Mill. For note that Mill
speaks of “again and again returning to it
[a puzzle] until it was cleared up.”</p>

<p>Both imply their agreement rather than state
it outright; Spencer by his use of the word
“forthwith” and Mill by his words “again and
again.” Here the practice of both differs from
that of the vast majority of men. Yet neither
thinker seemed to be clearly conscious how it
differed. The average man (that mythical
creature!) when he has just been confronted
with a problem, may wrestle with it with all the
vigor of a great thinker. But as he sees difficulties
multiplying about him, he gradually becomes
more and more discouraged. Finally he
throws up the problem in disgust, contenting
himself with the reflection that it cannot be
solved, or that it will take somebody who knows
more than he to solve it.</p>

<p>A real thinker, however, if confronted with
the same problem, will look for a solution from
every possible viewpoint. But failing an
answer he will not give up. Instead he will let
the subject drop for a while, say a couple of
weeks or perhaps longer, and then refer to it
again. This time he will find that certain obscurities
have become a little clearer; that certain
questions have been answered. He will
again attack his puzzle with energy. And if he
does not obtain a complete solution he will once
more put it aside, returning to it after another
interval, until finally a satisfactory solution
presents itself.</p>

<p>You may fail to see any difference between
thinking for two hours separated by two weeks,
and thinking for two consecutive hours. As an
experiment, then, the next time you come across
a puzzle which you fail to solve at first tilt, write
down all the unsatisfactory solutions suggested,
and all the questions, difficulties and objections
met with. You may leave this for a few weeks.
When you return to it a few of the difficulties
will look less formidable, and some of the questions
will have practically answered themselves.
(Of course some of the difficulties may look
more formidable, and a few new questions may
have arisen.) If a solution is not found at the
second attempt, the problem may again be sent
to your mental waiting room. But if it is only
of reasonable difficulty a solution is bound, soon
or late, to be discovered.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say just what effects this
change in thought, when apparently one has engaged
in no reflection during the interval.
The attempted solution probably gives a certain
“set” to our minds. Without being aware of
it we observe facts relating to our problem.
Ideas which occur to us in other connections
are unconsciously seen in their bearing on the
unsolved question. In short, “those proclivities
of thought which have probably been
caused unawares by experience” make themselves
felt.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that if we think too much
we will be liable permanently to injure our
mighty intellects. This has sometimes happened.
But there is no serious danger of it.
Thinking on one useful subject for a long while
will not hurt you any more than thinking on a
thousand different useless subjects for the same
period. But of course you should not try to
con­cen­trate when you are sleepy, when you
have a headache, when some other bodily pain
distracts your attention, or when your mind is
in any way tired. If you attempt to con­cen­trate
at these times you will endanger your mental
and physical health. Not only this, but the
thinking done during such periods will be of
such poor quality that it will be practically useless
if not harmful. This applies even to cases
where mental fatigue is almost inappreciable.
Thinking done in the evening seldom approaches
in efficacy the thinking done in the first hours of
the morning. But you should always make sure
your mind is actually tired. It may merely be
tired of a par­tic­u­lar subject.</p>

<p>An objection of a different kind may be raised
against con­cen­trating at every opportunity. It
has often been noticed that names have been
recalled and problems solved when we were
thinking of something else. It may be urged
that such solutions would not have occurred
when con­cen­trating, because the exact associations
which led up to them would not have been
present. This is occasionally true. But there
are still reasons why I must maintain my position.
No matter how well a man may have
trained himself to con­cen­trate, there will always
be short periods when his mind will wander,
and these will suffice for any accidental associations.
Moreover, the fact that these mind wandering
periods <i>occasionally</i> do good does not
excuse their existence. The most fallacious
ideas, the most demoniacal practices, the most
despicable characters of history, have <i>occasionally</i>
done good. The fact is that for every useful
association which occurs during mind wandering,
ten associations just as useful will occur
during con­cen­tration. The only reason useful
mind wandering associations appear frequent is
that they are unexpected, therefore more noticed
when they come.</p>

<p>It has been frequently said that many of the
world’s greatest inventions were due to accident.
In a sense this is true. But the accident
was prepared for by previous hard thinking.
It would never have occurred had not this
thinking taken place. It is said that the idea of
gravitation came to Newton because an apple
fell on his head. Perhaps. But apples had
been falling ever since there were apple trees,
and had probably been falling on men’s heads
ever since men had acquired the habit of getting
their heads in the way. The idea of the steam
engine is supposed to have come to Watt while
observing a tea kettle. But how many thousands
before him had not seen steam coming
out of kettles? The idea of the pendulum for
regulating time occurred to Galileo from observing
a swinging lantern in a cathedral. Think
how many others must have seen that lantern
swinging! It is probable that in all these cases
the invention or idea had been prepared for, had
been all but formed, by downright hard thinking
in previous periods of con­cen­tration. All
that was needed was the slightest unusual occurrence
to make the idea complete and conscious.
The unusual occurrence, the accident,
which has so often received the credit for the
invention or the idea, merely made it come
sooner, for with the thinking these men did, it
was bound to come eventually.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Of course I really do not seriously expect anybody
to con­cen­trate at every opportunity. I
don’t myself. I merely wanted to establish the
fact that it’s the best thing. But every man,
even the tired business variety, should set aside
at least half an hour a day, or three and a half
hours a week. I realize what a great hardship
it is for some people to devote one-forty-eighth
of their time to such a useless pastime as thinking.
But if they will make the sacrifice for
seven consecutive days they will find themselves
bearing up nobly at the end.</p>

<p>There is even a possibility that they may be
encouraged to extend the time.</p>

PREJUDICE AND UNCERTAINTY</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">“From time to time there returns upon
the cautious thinker, the conclusion that,
considered simply as a question of probabilities,
it is decidedly unlikely that his views upon
any debatable topic are correct. ‘Here,’ he reflects,
‘are thousands around me holding on this
or that point opinions differing from mine—wholly
in most cases; partially in the rest.
Each is as confident as I am of the truth of his
convictions. Many of them are possessed of
great intelligence; and, rank myself high as I
may, I must admit that some are my equals—perhaps
my superiors. Yet, while every one of
us is sure he is right, unquestionably most of us
are wrong. Why should not I be among the
mistaken? True, I cannot realize the likelihood
that I am so. But this proves nothing; for
though the majority of us are necessarily in
error, we all labor under the inability to think
we are in error. Is it not then foolish thus to
trust myself? When I look back into the past,
I find nations, sects, philosophers, cherishing beliefs
in science, morals, politics, and religion,
which we decisively reject. Yet they held them
with a faith quite as strong as ours; nay—stronger,
if their intolerance of dissent is any
criterion. Of what little worth, therefore,
seems this strength of my conviction that I am
right? A like warrant has been felt by men all
the world through; and, in nine cases out of ten,
has proved a delusive warrant. Is it not then
absurd in me to put so much faith in my judgments?’ ”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn9" id="fnanc9">9</a></p>

<p>I trust the reader will pardon this second
rather extended quotation from Herbert Spencer,
but the thought expressed must be kept in
mind if we are to approach our present subject
in the proper spirit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Our subject is prejudice. Our object is to
free ourselves as much as possible from our
own prejudices. But before we can get rid of
a thing it is first necessary to recognize that
thing when we see it.</p>

<p>Prejudice is often confused with intolerance.
They are not the same. A man may be prejudiced
and not intolerant. You may think that
your alma mater, your city, or your country, is
the greatest in the world, for little other reason
than simply that it is <i>yours</i>. Your opinion is
prejudiced. But you may not protest if any
other man thinks that <i>his</i> alma mater, or <i>his</i>
city, or <i>his</i> country, is the best in the world. In
fact you may not have much respect for him
if he doesn’t think so. And your opinion is
tolerant.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a man may be intolerant
and not prejudiced. You may decide, solely on
the evidence and on grounds of pure reason,
that paper money—fiat money—is always a
harmful form of currency, and you may be
justly wrathful against the man who advocates
it. You may even wish him suppressed. Yet
you may be able to answer all his arguments.
But you fear that if he is allowed to air his
views they will take hold on minds as shallow
as his own. You fear that once they have taken
root it will be difficult to dislodge them, and that
in the meanwhile they may do harm by being
put into practice. You are intolerant. But
you are not prejudiced. It is well to remember
this distinction when accusations of prejudice
are flying through the ozone.</p>

<p>One thing more must be kept in mind.
Prejudice has less connection with truth and
falsity than is generally supposed. The fact
that a man is unprejudiced does not make his
opinion right. And the fact that a man is
prejudiced does not necessarily make his opinion
wrong; though it must be admitted that if
it is right it will be so only by accident.</p>

<p>It is often thought that prejudice can be immediately
recognized. Locke says, “Every one
is forward to complain of the prejudices that
mislead other men or parties, as if he were free
and had none of his own. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is the mote
which every one sees in his brother’s eye, but
never regards the beam in his own.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn10" id="fnanc10">10</a> However,
slight con­si­der­a­tion will convince us that
because one man accuses another of prejudice,
it does not follow that the accused is guilty.
The general practice is to accuse of prejudice
any one whose views happen to differ from our
own.</p>

<p>Let us consider a formal dictionary definition
of prejudice: “Judgment formed without due
examination; opinion adverse to anything, without
just grounds or sufficient knowledge.”
This is not altogether satisfactory. A man
may form a judgment without sufficient knowledge
and still be unprejudiced. He may be perfectly
open minded and willing to change his
opinion if other evidence is adduced. But even
if the formation of a judgment without sufficient
knowledge is prejudice, it is often justified.
At all events, every one will agree that
the foregoing definition helps us little in discovering
our own prejudices. All of us, for instance,
believe our judgment on any given question
has been formed with due examination,
each being his own judge of what constitutes
“due.”</p>

<p>It is difficult to find any satisfactory definition.
Perhaps the best I can do is to point out
various specific forms of prejudice and their
causes. The first form of prejudice I shall
name consists in a love for, and a desire to hold,
some opinion. We may roughly ascribe this desire
to three causes:</p>

<p>(1) We desire an opinion to be right because
we would be personally benefited if it were.
Promise a man that if he invests his money in
the Lookgood Gold Mine he will receive dividends
of over 40 per cent. annually, and he is
in danger of becoming extremely gullible. He
shirks looking up the previous record of the promoters
or directors because he has a secret and
indefined fear that if he does he will find their
pictures in the Rogues’ Gallery. Advertise in
a magazine that any thin man can gain seven
to fourteen pounds a week by drinking Fattilac
and you will receive hundreds of answers enclosing
the fifty cents for a trial bottle. Not
one desperately slim man in ten will stop to
ask himself how the miracle can be performed.
In fact, he will do his worst to argue himself
into the matter. He will tell himself that the
advertisement is in a reliable magazine, that
the company would not dare to make an assertion
like that unless it could make good,
that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>But we may pass over the more obvious benefits,
and proceed to those causes of prejudice
less consciously selfish or directly beneficial.
If an economist were to write a book attempting
to prove that bankers were really unnecessary
and could be dispensed with, it is a rather
sure guess that a banker would not regard very
highly the in­tel­lec­tual powers of that economist.
If he considered his arguments at all, it would
be only with the view of refuting them. In an
even less conscious way, a rich man is likely to
oppose socialism or communism, not so much
because he has evidence of intrinsic worth
against them, but because he fears that if such
systems of society were put into effect he would
lose most of his wealth. The man who has
nothing is likely to look with favor upon these
schemes, because they offer him promise of
better things.</p>

<p>The mere fact that we are ignorant of a certain
thing will prejudice us against it, while
knowledge of it will prepossess us in its favor.
Ten chances to one a person who has been
taught Esperanto will favor the adoption of an
international language—and the adoption of
Esperanto in par­tic­u­lar. Most of the remarks
on the uselessness of the classics come from
those ignorant of them; while those who, in order
to get a college degree or for some like
reason, have been forced to study Greek and
Latin, will generally always exaggerate their
importance. Most of the opposition to simplified
spelling is due to the fact that having taken
the time and toil to master our atrociously inconsistent
spelling, people have a vague fear
that if a phonetic system were adopted, children,
the ignorant classes and persons of poor
memories would be able to spell just as well as
they, without one quarter the trouble of learning.
Not that they are conscious of this childish
and unworthy attitude, for usually they are
not, but the motive is operative none the less.</p>

<p>Of course in all the foregoing cases of prejudice,
as in those to follow, none of the victims
ever uses any of his real reasons in argument,
though he will bring forward nearly every other
reason on earth to justify his belief. And to do
him justice, it must be admitted that he is often
unaware of the true cause of his inclination to
one side rather than another.</p>

<p>Though it is less directly selfish, the patriotic
bias may fairly be classed with the prejudices
we have just been considering. At this
time the most stupendous war of all history is
raging. But I know of no German or Austrian
or Turk or Bulgarian who has so far admitted
that the British or the French or the Russians
or the Italians or the Belgians or the Servians
or the Montenegrins or the Japanese can by
any possibility have right on their side, nor do
I know of any Japanese or Montenegrin or
Servian or Belgian or Italian or Russian or
Frenchman or Englishman who believes that
the Bulgarians or the Turks or the Austrians or
the Germans are in the right. Philosophers
and men of science are no exception; Münsterberg,
Eucken and Haeckel write publicly in
favor of Germany and fifty of England’s foremost
authors unanimously sign a pronunciamento
in support of their native country—yet
nobody is surprised.</p>

<p>(2) Another reason why we desire an opinion
to be right is because we already happen
to hold it. As one writer expresses it, “We
often form our opinions on the slightest
evidence, yet we are inclined to cling to them with
grim tenacity.” There are two reasons for
this.</p>

<p>When we have formed an opinion on anything,
the chances are that we have communicated
it to some one, and have thereby committed
ourselves to that side. Now to reverse
an opinion is to confess that we were previously
wrong. To reverse an opinion is to lay ourselves
open to the charge of inconsistency. To
be inconsistent—to admit that our judgments
are human and fallible—this is the last thing
we can ever think of. “Inconsistency,” said
Emerson, “is the hobgoblin of little minds.”
And if by this he meant inconsistency in the
sense of changing opinions already formed, we
must agree with him.</p>

<p>The hypothesis maker has a specific form of
this fear of inconsistency. This type of theorist
makes a sup­po­si­tion to account for certain
facts. When he meets with certain allied
facts for which the sup­po­si­tion apparently does
not account, he either ignores said facts, or
cuts and trims them, or bullies them into his
theory. Hypotheses <i>per se</i> have never done
any harm. In fact they are indispensable in all
thought, especially as an aid to observation.
But it is the desire to prove an hypothesis correct,
simply because it is <i>our</i> hypothesis, or because
it is a fascinating hypothesis, which has
done harm. Darwin says that he had made it
a habit “whenever a published fact, a new observation
or thought came across me, which was
opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum
of it without fail and at once; for I
had found by experience that such facts and
thoughts were far more apt to escape from the
memory than favorable ones.”</p>

<p>The second reason for desiring to cling to
an opinion because we already hold it is one
which could probably best be explained by physiological
psychology and a study of the brain.
We feel almost a physical pain when a tenet
we have long cherished is torn up and exposed.
The longer we hold an opinion, the harder it is
for us to get rid of it. In this respect it is
similar to habit. Nor is the comparison an
analogy merely. An opinion is a habit of
thought. It has the same basis in the brain,
and is subject to the same laws, as a habit of
action. It is well known that the opinions of a
man over forty are pretty well set. The older
a man grows, the harder it is for him to change
an opinion—or for others to change it for him.</p>

<p>The side of a controversy we see first is
usually the side we see last. This is because
the arguments we meet do not have to shake up
or dislodge anything in our brain (unless we
are very critical, and we generally aren’t).
But once let an opinion gain entrance, and any
opinion contrary to it will have to dislodge the
old one before it can find a place for itself.</p>

<p>And as Mark Twain has remarked, “When
even the brightest mind in our world has been
trained from childhood in a superstition of any
kind, it will never be possible for that mind,
in its maturity, to examine sincerely, dis­pas­sion­ately,
and con­sci­en­tious­ly any evidence or
any circumstance which shall seem to cast a
doubt upon the validity of that superstition.”
Of course Mark Twain was wrong. Of course
we are The Reasoning Race, as he cynically intimates
we are not. To religion, for instance,
the most important question which can engage
our understanding, each of us always gives
in­de­pen­dent thought. It is a mere accident, of
course, that almost all of the 400,000,000 Chinamen
are Buddhists. It is a mere accident that
the overwhelming mass of East Indians are
Brahmans. It is only by chance that practically
all Turks, Persians and Arabians are
Mohammedans. And it merely happened to
happen that England is Protestant and Ireland
is Catholic. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But it is unsafe to bring this
question of religion too near home.</p>

<p>We now come to our third cause of desire:</p>

<p>(3) We desire an opinion to be wrong because
we would be forced to change other opinions
if it were not; or we desire an opinion to
be right because then we would be able to retain
our other opinions. This is a most widespread
form of prejudice. But I believe it is,
fortunately, the most defensible. Its defensibility,
however, depends mainly on the opinions
we fear to change. These we may divide into
two kinds:</p>

<p>(a) Those which have been formed without
thought; borrowed opinions, etc. The greatest
opposition to the theory of evolution came from
those conservative Christians who saw that it
undermined any literal interpretation of Genesis.
If these Christians had investigated the
sources of that book, had considered its probable
authority, had given thought to the possibility
of inspired writing, and had finally decided
in favor of the Biblical narrative; then—right
or not—their opposition to Darwin’s theory
would have been free at least from this
sort of prejudice. But most of this opposition
had come from persons who had not thought of
Genesis, but had accepted it from the first, because
it had been dogmatically hammered into
their heads since childhood. Hence it was
prejudice, pure and simple.</p>

<p>(b) The second kind of opinions we fear to
change are those resting mainly upon evidence.
William James gives an example:</p>

<p>“Why do so few ‘scientists’ even look at the
evidence for telepathy, so-called? Because they
think, as a leading biologist, now dead, once said
to me, that even if such a thing were true, scientists
ought to band together to keep it suppressed
and concealed. It would undo the uniformity
of nature, and all sorts of other things
without which scientists cannot carry on their
pursuits.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn11" id="fnanc11">11</a> Darwin writes that when a youth
he told Sedgwick the geologist of how a tropical
Volute shell had been found in a gravel pit near
Shrewsbury. Sedgwick replied that some one
must have thrown it there, and added that if it
were “really imbedded there, it would be the
greatest misfortune to geology, as it would
overthrow all that we know about the superficial
deposits of the Midland Counties”—which
belonged to the glacial period.<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn12" id="fnanc12">12</a></p>

<p>Some readers may object to calling the last
case prejudice. They may say that Sedgwick
was perfectly justified. That, however, is not
the present question. Prejudice itself may
sometimes be justified. But Sedgwick tacitly
admitted that he not only believed the shell had
not been imbedded, he actually <i>desired</i> that it
had not been. And our desires always determine,
to a great extent, the trouble we take to
get evidence, and the importance we attach to it
after we have it.</p>

<p>Emerson’s remark, that inconsistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds, is true in a double
sense. For not only is it harmful to fear to
change an opinion which we have entertained,
it is even harmful at times to fear to hold
simultaneously two opinions incongruous with
one another. If a thought springs up in your
mind, and you come to see after a time that it
is inconsistent with another thought, do not immediately
try to throw out one or the other. Instead,
think the new thought out in all its bearings
and implications, just as if you had never
had the first. Perhaps follow the same practice
with the first idea. By and by one will reveal
its falsity and the other its truth. Or more
likely you will find that there was some truth in
each idea, and you will reconcile the two in a
truth higher, deeper, or more comprehensive.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>I have set down these three cases of prejudice
to help the reader in recognizing the same
or similar prejudices in himself. And the mere
recognition of prejudices as prejudices will do
much toward their elimination. But though we
all strenuously maintain our anxiety to get rid
of prejudices, the real reason most of us have
them is that we do not want to get rid of them.
We are all willing to get rid of prejudice in
the abstract. But when some one troubles himself
to point out any par­tic­u­lar concrete prejudice
of ours we defend it and cling to it like a
dog to his bone. The only way we can get rid
of this desire to cling to our prejudices, is thoroughly
to convince ourselves of the superiority
of the truth; to leave not the slightest doubt
in our own minds as to the value of looking with
perfect indifference on all questions; to see that
this is more advantageous than believing in that
opinion which would benefit us most if true,
more important than “being consistent,” more
to be cherished than the comfortable feeling of
certainty. When we really do desire to get rid
of our prejudices we will put ourselves on the
path of getting rid of them. And not before
then.</p>

<p>One more prejudice has yet to be considered.
This may be called the prejudice of imitation.
We agree with others, we adopt the same opinions
of the people around us, because we fear
to disagree. We fear to differ with them in
thought in the same way that we fear to differ
with them in dress. In fact this parallel between
style in thought and style in clothing
seems to hold throughout. Just as we fear to
look different from the people around us because
we will be considered freakish, so we fear
to think differently because we know we will be
looked upon as “queer.” If we have a number
of such dissenting opinions we will be regarded
as anything from a mere crank to a fanatic or
one with a “screw loose.” When our backs are
turned people will wisely point their index fingers
to their temples and move them around in
little circles.</p>

<p>Our fear of freak opinions is only equalled
by our dread of ideas old-fashioned. A little
while ago it was considered popular to laugh
at the suffragettes. And everybody laughed.
Now it is getting to be popular to laugh at the
anti-suffragettes. A little while ago it was considered
quite <i>comme il faut</i> to fear socialism.
Now it is becoming proper to remark, “There is
really quite a good deal of truth in their theories.”
And soon we shall doubtless all be out
and out socialists.</p>

<p>Nor is the prejudice of imitation confined to
the layman. If anything, it is even more common
among so-called “thinkers.” I remember
quoting some remark of Spencer to an acquaintance,
and getting this: “Yes, but isn’t Herbert
Spencer’s philosophy considered dead?” This
same acquaintance also informed me that John
Stuart Mill had been “superseded.” He candidly
admitted—in fact seemed rather proud
of the fact—that he had read practically nothing
of either philosopher. I am not trying to
defend Spencer or John Stuart Mill, nor am I
attempting to bark at the heels of any of our
present-day philosophers. But I am willing to
wager that most of these same people now so
dithyrambic in their praise of James, Bergson,
Eucken and Russell will twenty-five years
hence be ashamed to mention those names, and
will be devoting themselves solely to Post-neofuturism,
or whatever else happens to be the
passing fadosophy of the moment.</p>

<p>If this is the most prevalent form of prejudice
it is also the most difficult to get rid of.
This requires moral courage. It requires the
rarest kind of moral courage. It requires just
as much courage for a man to state and defend
an idea opposed to the one in fashion as it
would for a city man to dress coolly on a
sweltering day, or for a young society woman to attend
a smart affair in one of last year’s gowns.
The man who possesses this moral courage is
blessed beyond kings, but he must pay the fearful
price of ridicule or contempt.</p>

<p>There is another form of this prejudice of
imitation radically opposed to this. Just as
with fashions in clothes there are people who
strive to imitate others, so there are people who
devote themselves entirely to being “different.”
Their greatest fear is that they will be
taken for “one of the mob.” They dress themselves
as uniquely as possible in order to acquire
“individuality.” We have these same
people in the realm of thought. They are in
constant trepidation lest they say something
that everybody else says. They say things not
for the sake of truth but for humor or paradox.
Their great delight is to affirm or defend something
“new” regardless of its truth; something
deliciously radical which will shock everybody
else and startle even themselves. The worst
part of this is that these people gradually come
to regard their propositions as true, just as a
liar finally comes to believe his own lies.</p>

<p>The only cure for such a mental condition
is a constant sincerity in every opinion we advance.
People are often led into the fault by
a motive not incommendable in itself—the desire
for originality. But they choose the wrong
path to their goal. If you make originality and
radicalness your aim, you will attain neither
truth nor originality. But if you make truth
your aim you will very likely get truth, and
originality will come of itself.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of prejudices, hundreds
of forms of prejudice. There is, for instance,
the prejudice of conservatism, which manifests
itself in a vague fear that if the present order
were changed in any par­tic­u­lar—if women were
given the vote, if socialism were to triumph, if
a new filing system were to be installed at the
office—all would be lost. But I cannot deal adequately
with all the forms of bias which flock
to mind.</p>

<p>The dis­tin­guish­ing mark of the great thinkers
of the ages was their comparative freedom
from the prejudices of their time and community.
In order to avoid these prejudices one
must be constantly and un­com­pro­mis­ingly
sounding his own opinions. Eternal vigilance
is the price of an open mind.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>Prejudice is not the only danger which lies in
wait for the would-be thinker. In his very efforts
to get rid of prejudice he is liable to fall
into an even greater in­tel­lec­tual sin. This sin
is uncertainty.</p>

<p>As uncertainty and doubt are nearly synonymous,
the reader will probably be surprised
at this statement because of the praise I have
hitherto accorded to the doubtful attitude. But
the doubtful attitude, necessary and praiseworthy
as it is, should not be maintained always.
We think in order to have opinions.
We have opinions in order to guide action; in
order to act upon should occasion require.
Herbert Spencer, even after his remarks quoted
at the beginning of this chapter, which imply
the need of extreme caution, adds, “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In
daily life we are constantly obliged to act out
our inferences, trustless as they may be— .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
in the house, in the office, in the street, there
hourly arise occasions on which we may not
hesitate; seeing that if to act is dangerous, never
to act at all is fatal.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>There are other reasons why we cannot afford
to keep the doubtful attitude. If our lives
were interminable, if we had limitless time for
thinking, we could afford to remain in doubt indefinitely.
But life is fleeting. So if you have
examined facts obtainable on such a question as
psychic phenomena, have kept your mind open
for a certain time, and have decided that communication
with the dead is impossible, you are
justified in discontinuing to look for evidence
on that question. Every hour devoted to examining
such evidence would be an hour taken
away from thought on some other subject, and
the law of diminishing returns is just as applicable
in thinking as in economics.</p>

<p>Another trouble with the attitude of doubt is
that when not properly utilized it hinders
rather than aids the acquisition of truth. This
is especially the case when it takes the form
of <i>fear of prejudice</i>. If guided by this fear, in
our anxiety not to dis­cri­mi­nate in favor of one
side of a question we are apt to dis­cri­mi­nate in
favor of the other. In an attempt to give an
opposing argument due con­si­der­a­tion, we are
liable to give it undue con­si­der­a­tion. Instead
of removing prejudice with reason we may be
trying to balance one prejudice with a counter
prejudice. When a person disagrees with him,
a very conscientious thinker, fearing that he
may be prejudiced, and in order to prove himself
broad-minded, will often say regarding an
objection, “Well, there may be something in
that.” Now your only excuse for ever saying,
“There may be something in that,” will be as
an attitude to assume in experimenting or observing,
or looking up material or arguments
to find whether there actually <i>is</i> anything in it.
Then, if you do not find anything in it you are
justified in saying so—and you ought to.</p>

<p>It is useless to stimulate doubt unless you
intend, on grounds of reason, to settle the doubt.
<i>The doubtful attitude should be maintained
only so long as you are actively searching for
evidence bearing on a question.</i> Maintained at
any other time or used in any other way it
means merely uncertainty, indefiniteness, vagueness,
and leads nowhere.</p>

<p>It is important that we be unprejudiced. It
is even more important that our views be definite.
And if our definite views are wrong? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But the words of Thomas Huxley on this subject
cannot be improved:</p>

<p>“A great lawyer-statesman and philosopher
of a former age—I mean Francis Bacon—said
that truth came out of error much more rapidly
than it came out of confusion. There is a wonderful
truth in that saying. Next to being right
in this world, the best of all things is to be
clearly and definitely wrong, because you will
come out somewhere. If you go buzzing about
between right and wrong, vibrating and fluctuating,
you come out nowhere; but if you are absolutely
and thoroughly and persistently wrong,
you must, some of these days, have the extreme
good fortune of knocking your head against a
fact, and that sets you all straight again.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn13" id="fnanc13">13</a></p>

<p>When you find yourself fluctuating back and
forth between two opinions you might find it
helpful to hold an internal debate. State to
yourself as strongly as possible the case for the
affirmative, and then put as convincingly as
possible the case for the negative, holding a refutation
if necessary. You may even elaborate
this by writing the arguments for both sides in
parallel columns. Of course you should never
use an argument which you can see on its face
to be fallacious, nor a statement which represents
merely a prejudice and nothing more.
You should use only such arguments as you
think a sincere debater would con­sci­en­tious­ly
employ. By thus making your reasons articulate
you will often find that there is really no
tenable case at all for one side, and you will
seldom fail to reach a definite conclusion.
This method of arriving at a decision may be
voted childish and even artificial, but nothing is
to be despised which can render in­tel­lec­tual
help.</p>

<p>One word more on this. There is a type of
individual, most often met with among writers,
who fears to make a statement of his thought
definite, because he has a faint suspicion that it
may be wrong. He wishes to allow himself
plenty of loopholes to slip out of an in­tel­lec­tual
position in case any one should attack it.
Hence he never says outright, “Such and such
is the case.” Instead, his talk or writing is
guarded on all sides by such expressions as “It
is probable that,” “it is possible that,” “the
facts <i>seem</i> to indicate that”; or “such and such
is <i>perhaps</i> the case.” Not satisfied with this
he makes his statement less positive by preceding
it with an “I believe,” or worse yet, with an
“<i>I am inclined</i> to believe.”</p>

<p>This is often done under the impression that
it is something noble, that it signifies broad­mind­ed­ness,
lack of dogmatism, and modesty.
It may. If it does, so much the worse for
broad­mind­ed­ness, lack of dogmatism, and modesty.
Never yield to the temptation to word
your thoughts in this manner. If you truly and
firmly believe that “such and such is the case”
<i>say</i> “such and such is the case”; not “it is possible
that such and such is the case,” or “such
and such is perhaps the case,” or “it is my belief
that such and such is the case.” People
will assume that it is your belief and not somebody
else’s.</p>

<p>Suppose you have made a positive statement.
And suppose you later find it to be wrong?
Well then, acknowledge that it is wrong.
Acknowledge that you have done something human;
that you have done something which every
man before you has done; that you have made
a mistake. I realize such a confession is hard.
It is the severest blow you can deal to yourself,
and few people will think the better of you
for doing it. Most of them will say, “See, he
acknowledges himself that he was wrong.”
And with these people, both you and your theory
will be far more discredited than if you had
clung to it until the end of your life, no matter
how obviously, how flagrantly, it opposed itself
to facts. But a few people will appreciate your
sacrifice. A few people will admire your bigness.
And you will grow. You will grow as
a thinker. What is more, you will grow morally.
And the time will come when you will
have fewer and fewer occasions to reverse yourself,
for you will learn to think longer before
you advocate an opinion.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>The question of the avoidance of prejudice
and the necessity of breaking off doubt, remains
still unsettled. There can be no doubt that the
two desideratums conflict; that to cut off doubt,
or even to refrain from stimulating it, is to encourage
by so much the dominance of prejudice.</p>

<p>The answer to this question will depend entirely
upon the par­tic­u­lar problem under con­si­der­a­tion.
No rules can be laid down. Everything
will depend upon the importance of the
question, upon the possibility or frequency of
occasions when we may be called to act upon
the answer, and upon the way in which the answer
will affect conduct when we do act upon
it. Where the importance of the question is
trifling, it would be foolish to sound our prejudices
too deeply, or to go to any elaborate pains
to collect evidence. Where immediate, unhesitating
action is required, remaining in doubt
might be fatal. Any decision would be better
than no decision. When the importance of the
question is vital, or when the possibility of having
to act on the answer is distant, we can afford
to preserve our doubts, to suspend final
judgment, for years—perhaps during our entire
life; and we should spare no pains to investigate
fully all that relates to the question.</p>

<p>Just how much trouble to take, how long to
keep alive the attitude of doubt in any par­tic­u­lar
question, will have to be decided by the individual.
His own judgment must be the sole
criterion.</p>

DEBATE AND CONVERSATION</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">
The mind engages in many activities which
have power either for evil or good. Just
what influence they will exert depends on how
we use them. One of the most important of
these activities is debate.</p>

<p>Debate brings in that unequaled form of incentive
for all action which psychologists call
“social pressure” and which here means nothing
more than the desire to excel a fellow-being
in some line of endeavor. When debating
we con­cen­trate, and we do so without conscious
effort. We are too interested in defeating our
opponent to wander from the subject. We are
forced to think rapidly. Not least of all, we are
compelled to think articulately.</p>

<p>But with all its advantages, debate is one of
the most potent sources of prejudice. In the
heat of controversy, we adopt any and every
argument that comes handy. Every statement
of our opponent is considered only in the light
of how it can be refuted. We are willing to use
almost any objection against him, so long as we
believe he will see no flaw in it. It is of utmost
importance that we find how to avoid these
pitfalls.</p>

<p>The first thing we must do is to adopt a complete
change of attitude toward an opponent’s
arguments. Whenever we meet with a fact
which we would not like to cite in a debate; because,
to put it mildly, it would not help our
side; we should carefully investigate that
fact. We should consider whether if true it
changes the aspect of things. We should get
rid of the idea that in order to vindicate our
side we must answer every contention our opponent
advances. For this opponent of ours
will very likely be a man in full possession of
his senses; at least some of his arguments will
be rational. When they are, we should be willing
to acknowledge it. Their truth does not
necessarily make his side right. His arguments
may be irrelevant; they may be outbalanced
by some other reason or reasons.
Attempts to prove too much are liable to put us
into the position of the lawyer whose client is
alleged to have been sued for putting a hole in
a borrowed umbrella. The lawyer proved first,
that his client did not borrow the umbrella; second,
that there was a hole in it when he got it;
third, that there was nothing the matter with it
when he returned it.</p>

<p>After you have had a friendly argument with
an acquaintance, you take leave either with the
sat­is­fac­tion that you have bested him, or with
a vague con­scious­ness that though you were
right, he was just a trifle more skillful at bringing
forward arguments. But having this satisfaction
or dis­sat­is­fac­tion, you seldom think any
more of the matter until the next time you meet
him. Now this practice is helpful neither to
your debating nor your thinking. After you
have taken leave of your acquaintance, and are
left to the quietude of your own thoughts, you
should mentally run over your controversy.
You should dis­pas­sion­ately con­sider the bearing
and weight of his arguments; and then, reviewing
your own, ask yourself which were valid
and relevant and which were not. If you find
you have used a sophism you should resolve
never to use it again, even though your opponent
may have been unable to answer it. The
question of morals aside, this is poor practice if
you ever hope to become a thinker. In the end,
it will tell against you even as a debater.</p>

<p>You can use your debates for constructive material
as well as for criticism. After a controversy
you can go over the arguments of your
opponent which you could not refute, or refuted
but lamely, and think of the answers you might
have given. Of course you should take care
that these answers are not sophistical. The
question will very likely come up again; if not
with the same friend, then with another, and
when it does you will find yourself prepared.</p>

<p>But the best debater, or at least he who gets
the most from debating, is the man who looks
for evidence and thinks not for debate, but to
obtain a correct conclusion. After he has
reached a conclusion in this manner, he does not
advance every possible reason to support it.
He does not even utilize the reasons on which
others base a similar belief, if he does not himself
accept these reasons. He states merely
that evidence and those reasons which have led
him to accept his conclusion, nothing more.</p>

<p>While we are considering debate, I may well
say a few words about conversation in general.
We do not and cannot always argue with our
friends, even though we scorn the dictums of
formal etiquette. But because we do not argue,
it does not follow that we gain nothing.
In fact, ordinary conversation has advantages
numerous over debate, not the least of which is
the comparative freedom it gives from prejudice.
But the value of conversation depends
both on what we talk about, and whom we talk
with. Too much of our talk is on petty matters,
is uneducative. And even if we converse
on worthy topics, it will profit us little if we
do not talk with worthy people. When we commune
with a dull mind, our thoughts are forced,
in some degree, down to the level of that mind.
But dull people do not usually talk of weighty
matters, nor do active intellects dwell long on
trifles. Therefore if we rightly choose our companion
we can con­sci­en­tious­ly leave our path of
conversation to choose itself.</p>

<p>One aspect of conversation remains to be
treated—its corrective power. “There is a sort
of mental exposure in talking to a companion;
we drag our thoughts out of their hiding-places,
naked as it were, and occasionally we are not
a little startled at the exhibition. Unexpressed
ideas are often carefully cherished until, placed
before other eyes as well as our own, we see
them as they really are.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn14" id="fnanc14">14</a></p>

<h2 class="h2herein">VII <span class="hsmall">
THINKING AND READING</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">Up to now I have dealt with thinking almost
as if it could be carried on without
external aid. As with cautionary and constructive
thought, I have perhaps been led to do
this because of a reaction from the usual insistence
upon reading as indispensable to mental
improvement, and the corresponding neglect
of the need for in­de­pen­dent thinking. Men
thought before there were books, and men can
still think without reading, but they cannot. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I was about to remark that they could not
read without thinking, but on second thought I
am inclined to doubt it. However, we have
clung to the natural order, for we first considered
unaided thinking, then the help given by
conversation and dispute, and finally we are to
examine the aid rendered by reading. There
can be no doubt that this order follows the
development of thought both in the individual and
in the human race.</p>

<p>While no complaint can be made of lack of
quantity in what has been written on reading,
most of it has not taken up the subject from
the proper standpoint; still less has dealt with
it in the right manner. There has been counsel
galore urging people to read; and recently
there has been a great deal of advice on what to
read. But comparatively very little has been
said on <i>how</i> to read. At one time reading was
regarded an untainted virtue, later it was seen
that it did us no good unless we read good books,
and now there is a dawning con­scious­ness that
even if we read good books they will benefit us
little unless we read them in the right way.</p>

<p>But even where this con­scious­ness has been
felt, little attempt has been made to solve the
problem sys­tem­at­ical­ly. Leisurely discourses,
pretty aphor­isms, and dogmatic rules have been
the forms in which the question has been dealt
with. Such conflicting adages as “A good book
should be read over and over again”; and “The
art of reading is the art of skipping,” are not
very serviceable. The necessity of some sort of
orderly treatment is evident.</p>

<p>Before we consider how to read, some queer
person may ask us to put the previous question,
“Should we read at all?” Now the value
of reading has, in times past, been seriously
doubted by thinkers and non-thinkers. The
philosopher Democritus put out his eyes so
that, ceasing to read, he might think. We are
not going to follow his example. But we can
readily sympathize with him when we think of
the many learned men who have read themselves
into dreamy stupidity; men who know what
everybody else thought, but who never have any
thoughts of their own. We must admit that
the arguments of these cranks are at least good
medicine for the prevalent belief that the more
a man reads the more he will know and the better
thinker he will become.</p>

<p>Learning to think by reading is like learning
to draw by tracing. In each case we make the
work of another man our basis, instead of observing
directly from Nature. The practice has
its value, it is true; but no man ever became a
great artist by tracing, and no man will ever become
a great thinker by reading. It can never
become a substitute for thought. At best, as
John Locke says, “Reading furnishes the mind
only with materials of knowledge, it is thinking
makes what we read ours.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn15" id="fnanc15">15</a></p>

<p>Our problem may be divided in two parts:
(1) What ratio should our reading bear to in­de­pen­dent
thinking, and (2) how should we read
when we do read?</p>

<p>It may be thought that we can learn something
about the first question by investigating
the practice of great thinkers. But the outcome
of such an investigation is likely to be
disappointment. Kant, for instance, was an
omnivorous reader; so were Huxley and Sir
William Hamilton; and outside the circle of
philosophers, men as unlike as Gibbon, Macaulay,
Milton and Thomas A. Edison. On the
other hand, Spencer seldom ever read, and
Hobbes is famous for his remark that if he had
read as much as other men he would have known
as little. Auguste Comte was unique in that he
read copiously until he conceived his Positive
Philosophy, and then hardly at all until the end
of his life.</p>

<p>Even were it found that most great thinkers
adhered to nearly the same practice, it would
prove little; for how could we tell whether they
were good thinkers on account of, or in spite
of it?</p>

<p>We can agree a priori, however, with the remark
of Schopenhauer that “the safest way to
have no thoughts of one’s own is to take up a
book every moment one has nothing else to do.”
And we may agree with him further: “A man
should read only when his thoughts stagnate at
their source, which will happen often enough
even with the best of minds. On the other
hand, to take up a book for the purpose of scaring
away one’s own original thoughts is a sin
against the Holy Spirit. It is like running
away from Nature to look at a museum of
dried plants, or gaze at a landscape in copper-plate.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn16" id="fnanc16">16</a></p>

<p>It would be folly to lay down any fixed
math­e­mat­i­cal ratio be­tween the time we should
de­vote to read­ing and the time we should give
to thinking. But one hour given to read­ing
plus one hour given to think­ing would be certainly
more ben­e­fi­cial than two hours devoted
entirely to reading.</p>

<p>You can find quite a number of serious-minded
men who put by a certain period each
day for reading. But how many of them put
by any time at all for thinking? It would be
unjust to say they do not think. But at best
their thinking is merely accidental—and ap­par­ent­ly
considered so. Surely it is as important
that we lay aside a definite period each
day for thinking as it is that we lay aside some
time for reading. But how much this time
should be and whether it should bear any specific
ratio to the time given to reading can best
be decided after a con­si­der­a­tion of the problem
of how to read.</p>

<p>This problem has unfortunately been much
mis­con­ceived. Those who have laid stress on
the maxim, “A good book should be read over
and over again,” have done so in the belief
that this is the best way to get the most out
of a par­tic­u­lar book. But the object of reading
is not to get the best out of any one book,
but out of reading in general. A realization of
this end will change our problem somewhat.</p>

<p>It will bring us to a con­si­der­a­tion, for example,
of the law of diminishing returns. While
the more we re-read a book the more we get out
of it, it must be remembered that with a few
possible exceptions, every time we re-read it
we add less to our knowledge than we did the
previous time. This means that we can usually
make much faster progress by reading other
books, in which case we do not merely read over
what we already know for the most part.
Whether re-reading is ever justified, and when,
is a question which will be considered a little
later.</p>

<p>The law of diminishing returns applies to an
entire subject as well as to a single book. That
is to say, past a certain point, every book we
read on a par­tic­u­lar subject, while it will probably
add to our knowledge, will not yield as
much return as a book of equal merit on another
subject, new to us.</p>

<p>The problem of reading asks how we can acquire
the greatest number of ideas, and how
we can arrive at truth rather than the verdict
of an author. It assumes a limited time and
asks how we can use that time most profitably.
Not least of all, it asks how we can best combine
our reading with original thought.</p>

<p>From the remarks already made, it is evident
that we cannot prescribe any one method for
dealing with all books. Even works of similar
nature and merit will be treated in different
ways, depending on the order in which we read
them, and like conditions. The mastery of any
book will not be an end in itself. It will be
subordinated to the larger end of obtaining the
best from reading as a whole. But for the sake
of clearness, I shall for the present consider
our end as the mastery of some par­tic­u­lar subject,
and shall indicate a plan of reading to best
serve that end. Needful qualifications will
come later.</p>

<p>I shall first outline a typical plan of study,
and then review and explain it in detail.</p>

<p>Assuming you have chosen a subject, your
first step should be to do a little unaided thinking
on it. Next I would advise the selection
of a comprehensive text book. This should be
read critically and written note made of the
problems taken up which you do not believe
have been adequately treated, or the solutions
of which are in any way unsatisfactory. These
you should think out for yourself. A second
book may in some cases be read in the same
thorough manner as this first one, and the problems
recorded in the same way. After that all
books on that subject may be read “hop, skip
and jump” fashion, for the new problems or
solutions they suggest.</p>

<p>I do not expect the foregoing plan to be
strictly adhered to, for the nature of the subject
studied will make certain changes necessary.
However, it demands more detailed explanation
and perhaps defense.</p>

<p>Let us take up the first step advised—giving a
little unaided thought to the subject. My only
reason for advising “a little” thinking, is that I
know if I asked more the reader would probably
do nothing at all. Indeed many readers will
fail to see the necessity of thinking about a subject
before studying it. Many may even question
the possibility of doing so. “How is a man
to think about a subject on which he knows nothing?”
you ask. Let us, however, consider.</p>

<p>The very fact that you want to study a subject
implies that the phenomena with which it
deals are not clear to you. You desire to study
economics, for instance, because you feel that
you do not understand everything you should
about the production, distribution and consumption
of wealth. In other words, something
about these phenomena puzzles you—you have
some unsolved problems. Very well. These
problems are your materials. Try to solve
them.</p>

<p>“But how can I solve them when I know nothing
of economics?”</p>

<p>Kindly consider what a science is. A science
is nothing more than the organized solution of
a number of related problems. These problems
and their answers have been changed and added
to the ages through. But when the science first
started there was no literature on it. It originated
from the attempts of men to solve those
problems which spontaneously occurred to them.
Before they started thinking these men knew
nothing of the science. The men who came after
them availed themselves of the thoughts of those
before, and added to these. The whole process
has been one of thought added to thought.
Yet, in spite of this, people still cling to the belief,
even if they do not openly avow it, that we
never can make any headway by thinking, but
that in order to be educated, or cultured, or to
have any knowledge, we must be reading, reading,
reading.<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn17" id="fnanc17">17</a></p>

<p>I almost blush for this elaborate defense.
Everybody will admit the necessity for thinking—in
the abstract. But how do we regard it in
the concrete? When we see a man reading a
good book, we think of him as educating himself.
When we perceive a man without a book,
even though we may happen to know that he is
engaged in reflection, we do not look upon him
as educating himself, though we may regard him
as intelligent. In short, our habitual idea of
thought is that it is a process of reviewing what
we already know, but not of adding anything to
our knowledge. Of course no one would openly
avow this opinion, but it is the common acting
belief none the less. The objections to thought
are inarticulate and half-conscious. I am trying
to make them articulate in order to answer
them.</p>

<p>To return, then, to the remark that we should
use as materials for unaided thinking the problems
which occur spontaneously. You will find
when you begin to solve these that other problems
will arise, and that up to a certain point,
the deeper you go into a subject—the more
critical you are in your thinking—the more
problems will occur. Perhaps it would be too
much to ask you to solve all of these. Yet even
a little of this preliminary thinking will be of
immense help in reading. It will give you a far
better sense of the importance of different problems
which a book considers, and you will not
judge their significance merely by the space it
devotes to them. An author may indeed bring
before us certain problems which had not hitherto
occurred, and stimulate in us a sense of
their importance. But this artificial stimulation
can never take the place of natural and
spontaneous wonder. Once we have obtained a
solution of a problem which has arisen spontaneously
and from within, we do not easily forget
it. Our in­de­pen­dent thinking, too, will have
given us an idea of the difficulties presented by
problems, and will make us more critical in
reading and more appreciative of the solutions
of an author. Not least of all, if we read first
we are extremely liable to fall into the routine
and traditional ways of considering a subject,
whereas if we first think, we are more likely in
our in­sophist­i­ca­tion to hit upon an idea of real
originality.</p>

<p>One last objection to thinking before reading
remains. Schopenhauer has answered it in his
forcible manner:</p>

<p>“A man may have discovered some portion
of truth or wisdom after spending a great deal
of time and trouble in thinking it over for himself,
adding thought to thought; and it may
sometimes happen that he could have found it
all ready to hand in a book and spared himself
the trouble. But even so it is a hundred times
more valuable, for he has acquired it by thinking
it out for himself. For it is only when we
gain our knowledge in this way that it enters
as an integral part, a living member, into the
whole system of our thought; that it stands in
complete and firm relation with what we know,
that it is understood with all that underlies it
and follows from it, that it wears the color, the
precise shade, the dis­tin­guish­ing mark, of our
own way of thinking, that it comes exactly at the
right time, just as we felt the need for it; that
it stands fast and cannot be forgotten.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn18" id="fnanc18">18</a></p>

<p>Despite the strong case that Schopenhauer
makes out, I am satisfied with my former advice—that
a little thinking will suffice. Not only because,
as already said, the reader will probably
do nothing if advised to do more; but because
after a certain amount of thinking has been
done, it is more profitable to avail ourselves of
the wisdom of the ages, stored in books, and to
do our thinking after we have acquired the main
outlines of this wisdom. For when we think a
problem out, with the feeling that even after we
have obtained a solution we shall probably find
it in a book later, we have not the incentive that
we have when we feel we have covered most of
the old ground and that thinking may bring us
into new territory.</p>

<p>The practice of Gibbon remains to be considered:
“After glancing my eye over the design
and order of a new book, I suspended the perusal
until I had finished the task of self-examination;
till I had revolved in a solitary walk all
that I knew or believed, or had thought on the
subject of the whole work, or of some par­tic­u­lar
chapter. I was then qualified to discern how
much the author added to my original stock, and
I was sometimes satisfied by the agreement,
sometimes armed by the opposition of our
ideas.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn19" id="fnanc19">19</a></p>

<p>The trouble with this method is that it is not
critical enough; that is, critical in the proper
sense. It almost amounts to making sure what
your prejudices are, and then taking care to use
them as spectacles through which to read. We
always do judge a book more or less by our previous
prejudices and opinions. We cannot help
it. But our justification lies in the manner we
have obtained these opinions; whether we have
infected them from our environment, or have
held them because we wanted them to be true, or
have arrived at them from substantial evidence
and sound reasoning. If Gibbon had taken a
critical attitude toward his former knowledge
and opinions to make sure they were correct,
and had then applied them to his reading, his
course would have been more justifiable and
profitable.</p>

<p>In certain subjects, however, Gibbon’s is the
only method which can with profit be used. In
the study of geography, grammar, a foreign
language, or the facts of history, it is well, before
reading, simply to review what we already
know. Here we cannot be critical because there
is really nothing to reason about. Whether
George Washington ought to have crossed the
Delaware, whether “shall” and “will” ought to
be used as they are in English, whether the verb
“avoir” ought to be parsed as it is, or whether
Hoboken ought to be in New Jersey, are questions
which might reasonably be asked, but
which would be needless, because for the purposes
we would most likely have in mind in reading
such facts it would be sufficient to know that
these things are so. We might include mathematics
among the subjects to be treated in this
fashion. Though it is a rational science, there
is such unanimity regarding its propositions
that the critical attitude is almost a waste of
mental energy. In mathematics, to understand
is to agree.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>We come to the second step outlined in our
plan of study—the selection of a comprehensive
text book.</p>

<p>Every large subject has gathered about it a
vast literature, more than one man can ever
hope to cover completely. This literature may
be said to consist wholly of two things: information
as to facts, and opinions on those facts.
In other words, any book you read on that subject
will probably contain some facts new to you
and will contain also the thoughts and reflections
of the author. Of course you should endeavor
to learn as many facts as possible. But
it is not necessary to know all that has been
thought about the subject. You are supposed
to have a mind of your own; you are supposed
to do some thinking for yourself. But though
it is not necessary that you know all that has
been thought, it is well that you know at least
part of what has been thought, and so far as
possible, the best part. For as just pointed out,
if you attempt to think out an entire subject for
yourself you will expend great energy and time
in arriving at conclusions which have probably
already been arrived at during the generations
that the subject has had its being. Therefore
you should endeavor to get, in as short a time
as possible, the greatest number of important
facts and the main outlines of the best that has
been thought.</p>

<p>So if you sincerely intend to master any subject,
the best way to begin is by the selection of
the most comprehensive and authoritative work
you can secure.</p>

<p>The man who desires to study any subject is
commonly advised to read first a small “introductory”
book, then a larger one, and finally the
largest and most authoritative volumes. The
trouble with this practice is that you will have to
study each book in turn. If you take up the
most thorough book first you need merely glance
through the smaller books, for the chances are
that they will contain little that is new to you,
unless they happen to be more recent. The only
justification for reading a small book first is that
the larger books are apt to be technical and to
assume a certain knowledge of the subject.
However, <i>the</i> authoritative treatise or treatises
on a subject usually refer far less to the smaller
books than the smaller books do to them. Any
greater depth of thought which the larger works
may possess can be made up for by increased
con­cen­tration on the part of the reader. Of
course if a man does not intend to master a subject
thoroughly, but only to get some idea of its
broad outlines, the case is different. He would
then be justified in reading a small work.</p>

<p>Another advantage of beginning a subject
with the study of a comprehensive and authoritative
volume or main textbook, is that you
avoid confusion. The man who has mastered
one foreign language, say French, will always
find his knowledge of great benefit to him for the
study of another language, such as Spanish.
But any one who has begun at about the same
time the study of two or more foreign languages
must remember his confusion, and how his vague
knowledge of one tongue hindered him in the
acquisition of the other.</p>

<p>So with reading. When we peruse a book in
the usual casual way we do not master it. And
when we read a book on the same subject immediately
after it, the different viewpoint is liable
to cause bewilderment and make us worse off
than before the second book was started. We
do not like to devote a lot of time to one book,
but would rather run through several books in
the same time, believing that we thereby gain
more ideas. We are just as mistaken as a beginner
in swimming who would attempt to learn
several strokes before having mastered one well
enough to keep afloat.</p>

<p>A main text being of such importance, its
choice involves responsibility. But how are we
to know whether one book is superior to another
until we have read both? And if we are confronted
with this difficulty even when familiar
with a subject, how much greater must be our
task when we know nothing of it? These difficulties
do not appear so formidable in practice.</p>

<p>Failing other means, the best method of selecting
a main text is by reputation. If we do
not even know what book has the best reputation,
we can easily find out by referring to so
acknowledged an authority as the Encyclopedia
Britannica, and consulting the bibliography in
the article on the subject.</p>

<p>But reputation does not furnish the only
means of selecting. By merely glancing
through a book, stopping here and there to read
entire paragraphs—a task of ten or fifteen minutes—we
can form an estimate which later reading
will usually justify. For an author betrays
himself in every line he writes; every slightest
remark reveals in some manner the breadth and
depth of his thought. But just how well we can
judge a book in this way depends both on our
own ability and on the time we devote to glancing
through it.</p>

<p>A few general requirements in a main text
have been implied in stating the purpose of having
one. The book with the best reputation is
not necessarily the best for you. In economics
Adam Smith’s <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, though easily
the most famous book on the subject, would
hardly be suitable as a main text because it has
been superseded. But though recency is always
an asset, this does not mean that the most recent
book is always or even usually the best. The
common idea, though it is usually but vaguely
formulated, is that the writer of the more recent
book has had all the previous books to draw
upon, and has therefore been able to extract the
best from all of them and add to this his own
thoughts. The fallacy of this has been pointed
out in the trenchant language of Schopenhauer:</p>

<p>“The writer of the new book often does not
understand the old books thoroughly, and yet
he is unwilling to take their exact words; so he
bungles them and says in his own bad way that
which has been said very much better and more
clearly by the old writers, who wrote from their
own lively knowledge of the subject. The new
writer frequently omits the best things they say,
their most striking illustrations, their happiest
remarks, because he does not see their value or
feel how pregnant they are. The only thing
that appeals to him is what is shallow and insipid.”</p>

<p>The value of recency will depend on the subject;
while it would be essential in aviation, its
importance would be far less in ethics.</p>

<p>It is not well to take as your main text a book
presenting a number of different and conflicting
viewpoints. One purpose of a main text is to
avoid confusion. Do not start the study of
psychology, for instance, by reading a history of
the subject giving the views of different thinkers.
Begin by taking up one definite system.</p>

<p>Finally, be sure to select a book covering the
entire field. Do not, for instance, take a volume
on the tariff to begin the study of economics.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>We pass now to the third step advised—to
read critically. By this I do not mean that we
should read skeptically or to confute everything
an author says. I mean simply that we should
resist our natural tendency to have our minds
swayed by every opinion he expresses. I mean
that before allowing an idea to slip into our
minds we should first challenge its truth; we
should examine its evidence.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have listened to a de­bate. After
the af­fir­ma­tive had made his im­pas­sioned plea
you were all for the af­fir­ma­tive. When the
neg­a­tive came for­ward and pre­sent­ed his case,
you found yourself favoring <i>him</i>. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why do
de­baters always try to get the last say? Why
is it that in a formal debate, the af­fir­ma­tive,
which usually has the last say, is most often the
side that wins? I could state the reason
bluntly. But if I did the honorable judges of
such con­tro­versies would not feel that their
critical powers had been com­pli­ment­ed.</p>

<p>The tendency to absorb the opinions of others
manifests itself to just as great a degree in reading.
I have held debating up as an example
merely because it brings out more strongly,
more strikingly, the effects of such a tendency.
But how can it be resisted?</p>

<p>If we have thought out a subject thoroughly,
if we have acquired a stock of clear and definite
ideas on it, criticism in reading will largely take
care of itself. By dint of our own thinking we
will know what is relevant and what is not; we
shall be able to judge the truth and importance
of the various arguments offered. The chances
are, however, that we shall not have given much
previous thinking to the subject, and that even
if we have we shall not have gone as far as the
author, who doubtless availed himself of other
books. Consequently certain problems which
he takes up will not even have occurred to us,
and hence will not have received our con­si­der­a­tion.</p>

<p>But where our thinking has not helped us, and
even where it has, we should look critically upon
every statement of an author, instead of lazily
acquiescing in it. The difference between
critical and ordinary reading, is that in the former
we look for objections, in the latter we wait
until they happen to occur to us. Even then we
do not hold our ob­jec­tions steadily in mind; we
are as likely as not to accept later arguments
based upon one we have previously objected to.
In order to avoid this perhaps the best we can
do when we object to any statement or believe
we have found a fallacy, is to make written note
of it in the margin. To some extent this will
prevent forgetting it. Too few or too many
marginal notes are both extremes to be shunned.
If we make too many we shall be apt to lose a
true sense of pro­portion and fail to distinguish
es­sential crit­i­cisms from non­es­sentials. The
only way we can keep clear of this extreme is to
avoid quibbling and hair-splitting, making only
such written criticisms as we feel we could
unblushingly defend before the author himself.
Often however we may feel that a state­ment is
untrue, or that an argument is fal­lac­ious, and
yet be unable to point out just where or how it
is so. In this case perhaps the best plan would
be merely to put a question mark in the margin
in order to remind ourselves that the statement
has not been fully accepted.</p>

<p>We ought to make sure what we object to because
it is a peculiarity of the human mind that
it does not require evidence for a statement before
accepting it; it generally accepts any statement
which has no evidence against it. Unless
we reject a statement and know why we have
done so, it is liable to insinuate itself in our reasoning,
and the longer it remains the more difficult
it is to get rid of it. This is why it is so
important to avoid as many pitfalls as possible
at the beginning of a subject.</p>

<p>The reader may find that even when he reads
critically he will accept a certain statement at
the time; and then perhaps much later, say a
month, an objection to that statement will occur
to him, or he will see that it at least ought to
be qualified. For an explanation of this we
must go back to an analysis of the thinking
process. Every idea which enters the mind,
either from in­de­pen­dent thinking or from reading,
is accepted as true if it is in full conformity
with our past experience <i>as we remember it</i>.
In all thinking or reading, the new idea arouses
associates on its entrance. An hypothesis or
principle, for instance, arouses in our minds
past experiences of par­tic­u­lar instances. If all
these conform it is accepted. But in ordinary
uncritical reading or thinking, only a few associates
are aroused. In critical reading, we look
for as many associates as possible, especially
those which do not conform. It is this purpose
kept in mind which helps to recall and awaken
these associates. No matter how critical our
attitude, however, we cannot at any given time
recall every relevant associate, though later a
“non-conforming” associate is likely to occur
to us by pure accident.</p>

<p>While you are criticising a book line by line,
and after you have finished reading it, you
should note the importance and relevancy of the
arguments accepted and rejected. While an
author may make a statement with which you
disagree, its truth or falsehood may not affect
the rest of what he has to say, or it may affect
merely a few corollaries drawn from it. In
other cases the truth of his entire conclusion
may depend upon it. Again, an author may in­con­tro­vert­ibly
prove something—which is entirely
without bearing on the subject. This
means that you should keep the precise question
constantly before your mind.</p>

<p>Often you will find an author making a statement
which really amounts to nothing more than
a mere airing of his prejudices, or at best the
bare statement of a conclusion. If he says,
“Socialism is the greatest menace of our civilization,”
and leaves it go at that, not telling how
or why, you should mentally note this as a statement,
as a statement merely; you should not
allow it to influence your opinion either way.
Finally, remember that though you may be able
to refute every argument an author brings forward
in support of a conclusion, his conclusion
may still be correct. It is possible for a man
to be right for the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>While I believe all the foregoing sug­ges­tions
are judicious and necessary, I am willing to
admit that their wisdom may reasonably be
doubted. But there is one practice about which
there can be no controversy—that of making
sure you thoroughly understand every idea of an
author. While most people will not verbally
contradict this advice, their actual practice may
be a continual contradiction of it. They will be
in such haste to finish a book that they will not
stop to make sure they really understand the
more difficult or obscure passages. Just what
they hope to gain it is difficult to say. If they
think it is wasting time to try to understand
every idea, it is surely a greater waste of time
to read an idea without understanding it. To
be sure, the difficulty of understanding may be
the fault of the author. It may be due to his
involved and muddled way of expressing himself.
It may be the vagueness of the idea itself.
But if anything this is all the greater reason
why you should attempt to understand it. It is
the only way you can find whether or not the
author himself really knew what he was talking
about. To understand thoroughly the thought
of another does not necessarily mean to sympathize
with it; it does not mean to ask how that
other came by it. It means merely to substitute
as far as possible concrete mental images for
the words he uses, and analyze those images to
discover to what extent they agree with facts.</p>

<p>Better to carry this out, you might follow another
practice of immense value. Whenever
you are puzzled as to an author’s meaning, or
whenever you do not care to accept his solution
of a problem but are undecided as to what the
solution is, or whenever you want to carry an
idea further than he has, or above all, whenever
an original and important relevant thought is
suggested to you, you should take your eyes
from your book—shut it if necessary—and let
your thinking flow on; give it fair play, even if
it takes an hour before your vein of suggested
thought exhausts itself. Of course this practice
will prevent you from finishing a book as
soon as you otherwise would. And if finishing
a book be your aim, I have nothing to say. But
if your end is to attain true, sound knowledge,
knowledge which you will retain; if your object
is to become a thinker, the practice will prove of
unspeakable benefit. It will not interfere with
con­cen­tration. Remember your object is to
con­cen­trate primarily on the subject, not on the
book; you intend to become a thinker, not an interpreter
or a commentator or a disciple of any
author.</p>

<p>And there are two reasons why this thinking
should not be put off until after you have
finished a book. The first and more important
is that after you have finished reading, most of
the ideas will have unrecallably dropped out of
mind. The second is that when you are undecided
about the solution of a problem, you will
often find later arguments depending upon that
solution. Unless its truth or falsity is decided
in your own mind you will not know how to deal
with these later arguments.</p>

<p>I have spoken of feeling that an argument is
fallacious, and of being unable to point out just
where it is so. To cease reading for a while,
and to endeavor to make these inarticulate objections
articulate, is excellent practice for training
analytic powers and developing clearness of
thought.</p>

<p>Another way of reading a book is what I
may call the anticipating method. Whenever
a writer has started to explain something, or
whenever you see that he is about to, stop reading
and try to think out the explanation for
yourself. Sometimes such thinking will anticipate
only a paragraph, at other times an entire
chapter. School and college text-books, and in
fact formal text-books generally, often contain
lists of questions at the end of the chapters.
Where you find these, read them before you read
the chapter, and where possible try to answer
them by your own thinking. This practice will
make you understand an explanation much more
easily. If your thinking agrees with the author’s
explanation it will give you self-confidence.
It will make you realize whether or not
you understand an explanation. If you were
not able to think the thing out for yourself you
will appreciate the author’s explanation. If
your thinking disagrees with that of the author
you will have an opportunity to correct him—or
be corrected. In either case your opinion
will rest on firmer grounds. Not least of all
you will be getting practice in self-thinking.</p>

<p>After reading and criticising a book, it is a
good practice to study one taking a different
viewpoint, or written even in direct opposition.
You will doubtless find that it points out many
fallacies and controverts many statements in the
first book, which you allowed to pass unchallenged.
Ask yourself what the trouble was.
Was your attitude too receptive? Did you swallow
words without substituting clear mental
images? Did you fail to trace out the consequences
of a statement? All these questions
will help you do better the next time.</p>

<p>Because of your ignorance of the facts, your
failure to refute a conclusion will sometimes
not be your fault. But even here, though you
cannot contradict an author’s statement of facts,
you can criticise conclusions drawn from those
facts.</p>

<p>Take an instance. In making an inquiry into
the causes of fatigue, Professor Mosso of Turin
selected two dogs as nearly alike as possible.
One he kept tied, and the other he exercised until
it was thoroughly tired. He then transfused
blood of the tired dog into the veins of the rested
one, and produced in the latter every sign of
fatigue. From this he concluded that fatigue
was due to certain poisons in the blood.</p>

<p>Now we cannot contradict the fact of this
experiment: that the rested animal was made to
look tired. But we can question the inference
drawn. The truth of the conclusion aside, was
the evidence sufficient to establish it? Might
not, for instance, similar results have been produced
upon the rested dog if blood of another
rested dog had been transfused into it? Had
Mosso made such an experiment? Other objections
should easily occur to one.</p>

<p>Questions which admit of treatment by studying
both sides are too numerous to mention.
The literature of philosophy furnishes par­tic­u­larly
good material. Examples which at present
occur to me are Sir William Hamilton’s
philosophy versus Mill’s <i>Examination of Sir
William Hamilton’s Philosophy</i>, and Herbert
Spencer’s <i>First Principles</i> versus William
James’ essay, <i>Herbert Spencer’s Autobiography</i>
and Henri Bergson’s criticism of Spencer
in his <i>Creative Evolution</i>.</p>

<p>Uncritical students of the history of philosophy
often find themselves agreeing with each
thinker in turn, no matter how much he contradicts
previous thinkers, and end by acquiescing
in the last system they read about. I remember
a philosophy class which completed its studies
with Pragmatism. Of course it was merely a
coincidence, but at the end of the course fully
nine-tenths of the students declared themselves
Pragmatists!</p>

<p>It is almost needless to remark that an author
who pretends to point out fallacies in another is
not necessarily right. There are men who pride
themselves on “reading both sides of a subject”;
but unless they have been critical, their
knowledge is not half as clear or as likely to be
true as that of a man who has read only one
side, but who has read it critically.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>We have now to consider the next step outlined
in the suggested plan of reading—“written
note should be made of the problems taken
up which you do not believe have been adequately
treated, or the solutions of which are in
any way unsatisfactory. These you should
think out for yourself.”</p>

<p>When reading a book you will often come
across a statement, perhaps an entire chapter,
with which you disagree. This disagreement
should be recorded in the form of a question;
as for instance, “Is such and such the case?”
You may doubt whether an author’s explanation
really explains. You may have a vague inarticulate
suspicion that he is sliding over facts,
or that his solution is too superficial. This suspicion
should also be recorded in the form of a
question. Often again, while reading, a problem
connected with the subject will occur to you
which the author has not even considered.
This too should be recorded.</p>

<p>All these questions should unfailingly be written,
either in the margin or on a piece of paper
or notebook kept always at hand. You should
then set aside a definite time for thinking
and attempt to solve the questions for yourself.</p>

<p>And in thinking for yourself you should not
make the author’s remarks the basis of your
thinking. You should deal with a problem almost
as if it had never occurred to any one else
but you. Simply because somebody else has
been satisfied with a certain solution, that is no
reason why you should be. You should deal
directly with the facts, data and phenomena under
con­si­der­a­tion; not with the opinions of
others about those facts, data and phenomena.
You should not ask yourself whether the pragmatists
are right, or whether the nominalists
are right, or the socialists, or the evolutionists,
or the Democrats, or the Presbyterians, or the
hedonists, or what not. You should not ask
yourself which “school” of thinking you ought
to belong to. You should think a problem out
<i>for yourself</i>, in every way that phrase implies.
At the end you may, incidentally, find yourself
agreeing in the main with some school of
thought. However, this will be only accidental,
and your thought will be much more likely to be
true. But you should never agree with a school
of thought any more than in­de­pen­dent thinking
leads you to.</p>

<p>Of problems dealt with in this manner, some
will take ten minutes, others a week. If you
encounter a par­tic­u­larly obstinate problem it
may be best to leave it for a while, say a week
or two or even longer, and go on with other
problems. When problems are thus recurrently
treated it may take months, even years, before
a satisfactory solution is reached. In such
cases you should be willing to give months and
even years to their solution. If a problem is
not important enough to devote so much time
to you may be forced to abandon it; but you
should constantly keep in mind the fact that
you have not solved it, and you should be willing
to admit to others that you have not solved
it. Never allow mere in­tel­lec­tual laziness to
stifle your doubts and make you think you have
solved a problem, when you know in your heart
of hearts that you have worked yourself into
the state of belief merely to save yourself mental
discomfort.</p>

<p>When most of your problems have been solved
and your views made definite you may resume
your reading. You may proceed to other books
on the subject.</p>

<p>As to the sug­ges­tion that another book on the
subject might be dealt with in the same manner
as this first one: this will depend largely on the
individual subject. It will depend on just what
books have been written on that subject. If
none completely or adequately covers the field,
or if there are two or more good books representing
radically different viewpoints, more
than one book probably ought to be studied in
this comprehensive manner. But this must be
left to the reader’s discretion.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>We come now to the last part of our plan—“after
that all books may be read ‘hop, skip and
jump’ fashion, for the new problems or solutions
they suggest.”</p>

<p>I have already implied the necessity for this
in formulating the law of diminishing returns.
After we have read several books on a subject
it would be manifestly foolish to continue reading
books on that same subject <i>in toto</i>. We
would merely be going over again knowledge
already in our possession, instead of using our
time more profitably by entering new territory.
But any good book will contain <i>something</i>
unique; some facts or principles to be found
nowhere else; or perhaps merely an unusually
clear way of explaining some old principle,
or a new light on it. This we should endeavor
to get without wasting our time by plowing
through the entire volume.</p>

<p>Theoretically our problem is difficult; on its
face it would seem impossible. We are to read
all the important parts of a book; that is, the
parts most important <i>for us</i>, and nothing but
the important parts. But until we read it how
are we to know whether any given part of a
book is important? In practice, however, our
difficulty is not so formidable.</p>

<p>We can eliminate the greater mass of the relatively
useless part of a book by a glance at its
table of contents. If we see there titles which
suggest subjects or aspects of subjects in which
we are not interested, or that we feel we already
know enough about, or that are simply outside
the par­tic­u­lar purpose we have in consulting
that book at all, we can omit those chapters and
confine ourselves to the others.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>When we were children first learning to read
we had to look at every letter in a word, then
spell it out. Finally its meaning dawned upon
us. As we became more proficient we did not
have to look at every letter; we could read
words as wholes with the same rapidity as the
separate letters. Accurate psy­cho­log­i­cal tests
have determined that a man can read such words
as “and” and “the” with even greater rapidity
than any single letter composing them. We
finally reach the point where we can read short
phrases at the same rate as we formerly could
single words.</p>

<p>But the secret of the scholar who can cover
efficiently much more ground than ordinary men
is not so much that he reads <i>faster</i>, as that he
reads <i>less</i>. In other words, instead of reading
every word he glances down a page and sees certain
“cue” words or rather “cue” phrases, for
the eye and mind take in phrases as wholes. If
he is familiar with the subject (and he is not to
employ this method unless and until he is) he
knows immediately, by “a sort of instinct” as
Buckle called it, whether any new or valuable
thought is on that page. When he finds that
there is he involuntarily slackens his pace and
reads that thought at ordinary reading pace or
even slower. Sometimes indeed he will read
whole chapters slowly, word for word, if the contents
are sufficiently novel and important to warrant
it.</p>

<p>Read by this “hop, skip and jump” fashion a
book the size of the present volume might take
an hour or even less. But it is almost impossible
to give even an approximate estimate of
the time such reading ought to take. Of course
the longer you spend the more you will get out
of a book, but the return per time invested will
be less and less. On the other hand if you read
the book too fast you may be wasting your time
altogether; you may end by understanding nothing
at all. Much will depend upon the originality
and depth of the book, upon the reader’s
familiarity with the subject, and upon his native
mental qualities.</p>

<p>Many may object to practicing the foregoing
method because they have a vague feeling that
it is their duty to read every word in a book.
I suspect that the real reason for this is simply
so that when asked they can con­sci­en­tious­ly say
they have <i>read</i> the book. Whereas if they had
followed this skipping method they would be
able to say only that they had “glanced through
it” or at best that they had “read parts of it.”
To this objection I have nothing to say, for I am
confining my remarks to those in search of truth
and knowledge rather than conversation and the
good opinion of those who believe that reading
from cover to cover is the only path to wisdom.
I might point out in passing, however, that if we
do follow this method there will be a half dozen
books which we can say we have “glanced
through” to one which we would otherwise have
been able to say we had “read.”</p>

<p>This way of dealing with a book is constructive
and positive as opposed to the negative
method of critical reading. For we read for
sug­ges­tion only; we carry forward some line
of thought of an author, which is better for in­tel­lec­tual
development than trying to find if he
was wrong and where he was wrong. Not only
is this positive method more interesting; in some
respects it is better even for criticism. For in
carrying forward an author’s line of thought,
noting its consequences and implications and
considering different cases where it applies, we
find whether or not it leads to absurd conclusions;
whether or not all concrete instances conform
with it. It should be kept in mind that
this method is not to be followed until the main
text-book has been studied. Consequently
when it is followed your mind will have been
fortified by previous reading and thinking;
valuable thoughts of an author will tend to impress
you and be remembered, while his trite
or erroneous ideas will tend to be ignored.</p>

<p>But after all, what is important is not your attitude
or method at the time of reading a book,
but the thinking done later. The critical attitude
has its shortcomings, for when we are on
the lookout for an author’s mistakes we often
miss the full significance of his truths. On the
other hand when “reading for sug­ges­tion” we
may too often allow an error to pass unquestioned.
But both these disadvantages may be
overcome if we do enough thinking afterward.</p>

<p>Only one thing I must insist on: make sure
you understand every sentence of a book. Do
not “guess” you understand it. Do not slide
over it in the hope that the author will explain
it later. Do not work yourself into the belief
that after all it is not really important. Rather
than this, better by far do not read the book at
all. Not only will you get little or nothing from
it but you will be forming the worst of in­tel­lec­tual
habits—that of thinking you understand
when you do not. If you have made every reasonable
effort to understand an author and then
have not succeeded, write in the margin “I do
not understand this,” or draw a line alongside
the sentence or passage. If you have to do this
too often you should put the volume aside for a
time. It is either too advanced for you or it is
not worth reading.</p>

<p>As to the thinking you do after reading.
Often problems connected with the subject of a
book you have read may arise spontaneously in
mind, or an objection to a statement may suddenly
occur to you when thinking on some other
topic. Of course when this happens you should
not stifle your thoughts. But besides this,
definite periods should be put aside for thinking
on what you have read and on the problems you
have written. I cannot insist on this too strenuously
or too often.</p>

<p>A good task to set before yourself is to take
every idea you agree with in a book and try to
treat it as a “germ.” Tell yourself that you
will develop it beyond the point where the author
left off. Of course this will not always be
possible. You will seldom succeed. But there
is nothing like hitching your wagon to a star,
and it will do no harm to set this up as an ideal.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>A few miscellaneous problems remain to be
considered.</p>

<p>How should we deal with authors with whom
we disagree fundamentally? Herbert Spencer
relates that he twice started Kant’s <i>Critique of
Pure Reason</i>, but disagreeing fundamentally
with the first and main proposition he ceased
reading. Now to do this is to give an author too
much credit for consistency. For even if every
other proposition he sets forth is ostensibly a
corollary from his leading one, some of them
will contain much truth. It is impossible to be
consistently wrong. Add to this the possibility
that the author may be right on his first proposition
after all. However, no book with a viewpoint
radically different from our own should be
used as a main text, for we would get little
benefit from it. If the book is by an obscure
author we may safely lay it aside altogether.
But if it is by so famous and so bepraised a
philosopher as Kant we should at least glance
through the entire volume for sug­ges­tions.</p>

<p>How many times ought we to read a book? I
have already partly answered this in formulating
the law of diminishing returns. Few books
are worth re-reading. Rather than read one
book twice on any given subject it will most
often be more profitable to read another book
on it. For the second will not only serve as a
review of previous knowledge, but will furnish
you with new ideas, different aspects and new
problems.</p>

<p>Certain books, however, can never be replaced
by others. They occupy this position either because
they deal with a subject not elsewhere
dealt with or because they take an entirely novel
aspect, or solely because they are the works of
supreme genius, for while the main conclusions
reached in works of this last type may be found
elsewhere, the <i>manner of thinking</i> can never be.
These books should be read twice. The main
text-book selected on any subject will usually
be chosen because it is the best and most comprehensive
work on that subject. For this reason
it should be read a second time even if such
reading is only of the hop, skip and jump
variety.</p>

<p>We should not re-read a book immediately
upon the first completion but should always
allow a long interval to elapse. There are several
reasons for this. After an interval we acquire
perspective; we are in a position to know
whether a book has done us any good and just
about how much. We may find after this interval
that a work of which we thought quite
highly at the time of reading has really not
helped us appreciably either in thought or action.
We may find that we have outgrown the
need of it. Even if we finally decide to re-read
we shall find the wait of immense help to our
memory. If we re-read a book after an interval
of six months, three years after our second reading
we will remember its contents much better
than if we had read it three times in unbroken
succession. Add to this that in the lapse of
time we shall have forgotten most of the work,
and shall therefore approach it the second time
with greater interest than if it were still fresh
in mind; that our experience, reading and thinking
in the meantime will make us see every sentence
in a different light, enabling us to judge
our own marginal criticisms (if we have made
any) as well as the book, and the advantage of
waiting cannot be doubted. I do not believe it
will ever be necessary to read a book more than
twice, that is, so far as thought and knowledge
are concerned. With books read for their
style or for mere amusement the case is different.</p>

<p>How long should one read at a sitting? Some
men find that their thought is choked by reading.
Some find it stimulated. But results vary
according to the length of time reading is carried
on. Reading for very long periods at a
stretch often deadens original thought. The
writer finds that he nearly always derives benefit
from reading for short periods, say ten or fifteen
minutes. This is in some measure due to
the increased con­cen­tration which short periods
allow. On the other hand, some people find that
a certain momentum is acquired during long
reading periods. The reader can only experiment
to find how long a period best suits his individual
case.</p>

<p>How about con­cen­tration? This has been considered
in relation to in­de­pen­dent thinking, but
in reading the problem is somewhat different.
In thinking our task is to choose relevant associates.
In reading the associates are chosen
for us. Our task is to stick to them, instead of
following the associates which occur to us either
from what we read or from sights and sounds
about us. But associates which occur to us
from what we read are of two kinds: relevant
and irrelevant, and the former should of course
be followed out. This however should be done
deliberately, in the manner I have previously indicated,
and when the vein of suggested thought
has been exhausted we should bring attention
back to our book. The problem of con­cen­tration
is not a very serious one in reading. It
may sometimes be difficult to con­cen­trate on a
book. But it is infinitely easier than con­cen­trating
on a problem by unaided in­de­pen­dent
thought.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>The plan of reading I have laid out is merely
suggestive. What I chiefly wanted to show was
that all books cannot be treated alike, that we
cannot lay down dogmatic inflexible rules to
apply to every volume. Our method of reading
will vary with the nature of a book or of the subject
it treats. It will depend upon the books we
have already read and even upon the books we
contemplate reading later.</p>

<p>The good you get out of reading will depend
entirely on how you allow it to affect you. If
every book you read suggests more problems,
gives you worth-while questions and topics
to think about in spare moments, enriches your
in­tel­lec­tual life and stimulates your thought, it
is performing its proper function. But if you
read solely to answer problems you cannot answer
for yourself, if every time you are puzzled
about anything you run to a book to have it explained,
and accept without question the explanation
there given; in short, if you use your
reading to save yourself from thinking, you had
better stop reading altogether. Smoking is a
far less harmful form of dissipation.</p>

<p>I have not yet definitely indicated the ratio
which time given to reading should bear to time
devoted to thinking. I have avoided this because
of the many factors to be taken into account.
But if the reader happens to have a
spare hour to devote to the improvement of his
mind, he will not go very far wrong if he gives
thirty minutes to reading and thirty minutes to
thinking. His thinking may be on the subject
he has read, or part of it may be on other problems.
That is not so important. But the
reader must not imagine that his thinking need
be restricted to these thirty minutes or any other
thirty minutes. The glorious advantage of
thinking is that it can be fitted in at any odd moment.
The entire apparatus for carrying it on
is always with you. You do not even need a
book for it. I remind the reader of this at the
risk of repeating myself.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>It was pointed out at the beginning of this
chapter that the reading of any book is not an
end in itself, but should be subordinated to the
larger end of obtaining the best from reading in
general. But for the sake of clearness our end
was temporarily considered as the mastery of
some par­tic­u­lar subject. I indicated a plan
of reading to best serve that end. I also promised
that needful qualifications would come
later.</p>

<p>In stating the law of diminishing returns it
was pointed out that it applied to whole subjects
as well as to books, that “past a certain
point every book we read on a subject, while it
will probably add to our knowledge, will not
yield as much return as a book of equal merit on
another subject new to us.”</p>

<p>While this is true it applies to but a small extent
when subjects are read by the method just
outlined, for while we do not get as much out
of any book as we would out of one of equal
merit on another subject, we read it so much
faster that the return per time and energy expended
is practically as great. This fast reading
is made possible by our previous knowledge
on the old subject. If the book on the new subject
were read in the same manner, we might get
little or nothing from it.</p>

<p>With this objection out of the way I suggest
that the reader get a specialty. Books read in
the ordinary unsys­tem­at­ic fashion, now on this
subject and now on that, leave little permanent
impression. Even if they do, we feel that
though our range of reading may be wide we
have at best but a smattering of many things.
In the final analysis a smattering of knowledge
is in most cases of no more use than total ignorance.
Better by far be ignorant of many things
and know one thing well, than know many things
badly.</p>

<p>Besides the utility of having a specialty is the
pleasure we derive. There is always an intense
satisfaction in feeling that one is an “expert,”
an “authority” in some subject. When some
Congressman makes an inaccurate remark
which trespasses on your specialty you can
write a letter to the <i>Times</i> or the <i>Sun</i> explaining
the error of his ways, and incidentally exhibiting
your own limitless erudition. When
your friends get into an argument on some question
within your chosen field they will remark,
“Ask John Jones. He ought to know.” And
even when you have to confess abysmal ignorance
on some question outside of your domains,
you may still have the satisfaction of believing
that people are excusing you within themselves
with an “Oh, well, but he knows a lot about
someology.”</p>

<p>One writer estimates that “fifteen minutes a
day or a half hour three days a week devoted to
one definite study will make one a master in that
field in a dozen years.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn20" id="fnanc20">20</a> This statement
should interest those people who “haven’t the
time” to take up any specialty outside their own
business, but who spend at least half an hour
every day in newspaper or magazine
reading—with nothing to show for it at the end of twenty
years.</p>

<p>Just what subject you make your specialty I
am not at present concerned. It may be
aeronautics, astronomy, banking, Greek history,
differential calculus, social psychology, electricity,
music, philosophy of law, submarines, soap
manufacture, religion, metaphysics, sun-motors,
education, literary style or the moon. But
whatever it is, it ought to be a subject in which
you are interested for its own sake—which most
frequently means one which you do not make
your vocation. If you get tired of it, drop it
and take up something in which you are interested.
Your thinking and study should be pursued
as a pleasure—not as a duty.</p>

<p>If your subject is a narrow one, if let us say
it is merely a branch of what is generally considered
a science, you should first get a clear
idea of the broad outlines of the science before
taking the specialty up. Should you, for instance,
select the tariff, begin your study by using
as your main text a book on general economics.</p>

<p>Even if you make your specialty an entire
science you will derive great help by reading
in other sciences. In ethics, for instance, a
knowledge of psychology, biology and sociology
will prove of surprising value. This means
that for the sake of knowing the specialty itself,
if for nothing else, you should not pursue
it exclusively. If ever you find yourself in danger
of doing this it would be well to lay down
a rule that every third or fourth book you read
must be one which does not deal with the subject
you have chosen as your own.</p>

WRITING ONE’S THOUGHTS</span></h2>

<p class="pepigraph">
Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready
man, and writing an exact man.—<span class="smcap">Bacon.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">Any attempt to formulate a science or art
of thinking would not be complete with­out
at least some dis­cus­sion of writ­ing. Indeed
writing is so closely bound up with thinking that
I have been compelled to refer to it several times
in the discussion of thought and reading.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of writing as an aid to
con­cen­tration. I was wont to depreciate it on
account of its slowness. But this is practically
its only fault. Thoughts come to us when writing
which we get in no other way. One is often
surprised, when reading some­thing one has
written at a previous time, at some of the remarks
made. We seem to have tem­por­arily
grown wiser than ourselves.</p>

<p>But the great advantage of writing is that it
preserves thought. What printing has done for
human­i­ty in preserving the knowledge of the
ages, writing will do for the individual in preserving
his own reflections.</p>

<p>When some thought has occurred to us we believe
at the time we are thinking it that it is ours
forever. We cannot conceive that it shall ever
be forgotten. Perish that belief! I have sometimes
had an idea occur to me (really!), and
have believed it ab­so­lute­ly new, at least so far
as I was con­cerned. But on looking over things
writ­ten before, I have found that I had had almost
iden­ti­cal­ly the same thought at another
time. Not only did I forget the idea; I did not
even recognize it at its second appearance. To
be sure, in these cases the thoughts came a second
time. But thoughts are seldom so obliging.</p>

<p>Therefore when an idea occurs or when you
have solved a problem, even a problem suggested
by a book, you should immediately put
the idea or solution in writing. You may of
course wait until the end of the day. But the
safest way of capturing an idea is to write it
the minute after it flashes through your brain,
or it may be lost forever. It was with this in
mind that in the chapter on reading I advised
immediately writing not only ideas but problems
which occurred to one. The discovery of a
new problem is just as important and necessary
for in­tel­lec­tual advance as the solution of an old
one. If we do not write our problems we are
apt to forget they exist; we put ourselves in
danger of assuming without question some
proposition which is not true.</p>

<p>To facilitate the writing of your thoughts and
meditations I suggest a notebook kept specially
for that purpose. In addition to this you should
always carry about with you some blank paper
and a pencil, so as to be ever ready to jot down
anything. To write an idea does not of course
imply that you cannot later reject it, or change
it, or develop it further.</p>

<p>The elusiveness of thoughts is most strikingly
brought out when writing them down. When
we are writing a long sentence we have in mind
the exact words with which we are going to
finish it. But our attention is called for the
moment to the physical act of writing, and presto!—the
words are gone; we are compelled to
end our sentence in a different way. I have
mentioned the advantages of shorthand and
typewriting for keeping pace with thought. I
need merely repeat my advice to use these acquirements
if you have them. Thoughts, I
must repeat, are fleeting. No device for trapping
them should be despised.</p>

<p>Not least among the advantages of a notebook
in which to write thoughts is the permanent
historical record it gives. Every thought we
write should be dated, day, month and year,
like a letter. When we come to read over ideas
jotted down from time to time in this manner,
we shall see before us an in­tel­lec­tual
autobiography. We shall see how our recent
thoughts compare with those written sometime
ago. We shall see just what our opinions were
at certain times, and how they have changed.
And we shall see whether our mental progress
has been marked, or whether we have been standing
still.</p>

<p>It may be considered absurd to suggest that
every thought you write in your note-book be
put in the best style you can command. We are
wont to differentiate “style” and “matter.”
It is doubtful whether this distinction is quite
valid. It is doubtful whether we know just what
we mean when we make it. Indeed Arnold
Bennett goes so far as to say:</p>

<p>“Style cannot be distinguished from matter.
When a writer conceives an idea he conceives
it in the form of words. That form of words
constitutes his style, and it is absolutely governed
by the idea. The idea can only exist in
words, it can only exist in one form of words.
You cannot say exactly the same thing in two
different ways. Slightly alter the expression,
and you slightly alter the idea. Surely it is
obvious that the expression cannot be altered
without altering the thing expressed! The
writer, having conceived and expressed an idea,
may, and probably will, ‘polish it up.’ But
what does he polish up? To say that he polishes
up his style is merely to say that he polishes
up his idea, that he has discovered faults
and imperfections in his idea, and is perfecting
it. The idea exists in proportion as it is expressed;
it exists when it is expressed, and not
before. It expresses itself. A clear idea is expressed
clearly and a vague idea vaguely.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn21" id="fnanc21">21</a></p>

<p>Mr. Bennett, I suspect, is a victim of ex­ag­ger­a­tion.
But this much is true: Thought and
style are mutually dependent to a far greater
degree than is generally supposed. Not only
will an im­prove­ment in a thought improve its
wording; an im­prove­ment in word­ing will im­prove
the thought.</p>

<p>Now as to the application of this. I have referred
to the occurrence in reading of “inarticulate”
objections. The sole reason these are
inarticulate is because the objection is too vague
even to find expression. In a case like this we
should word our objection the best we can, no
matter how ridiculous or indefensible it at first
sounds. But we should word it in as many ways
as possible; we should say it in all different
sorts of ways; we should write it in every different
kind of way. Gradually our objection
will become definite, clear, forceful. In short,
we shall not only have improved our way of
stating our thought; we shall have improved the
thought itself. To study clearness of statement
or acquisition of vocabulary is to study means of
improving thought. Your notebook should not
be used solely for the entry of “thoughts” as
such, but any striking way of wording a thought
which occurs to you should likewise be immediately
written.</p>

<p>But while there is some truth in Arnold Bennett’s
statement that the wording is the thought,
from another point of view its very opposite is
true. The wording is <i>never</i> the thought.
Strictly speaking, “thought” is something
which can exist only in the mind. It can never
be transferred to paper. What then is it that
we write? If words and sentences are not
thought, what are they? If they are not thought
how is it possible to transfer thought through
the medium of writing?</p>

<p>The fact is that words, though they are not
thought, are the <i>associates</i> of thought. You
hear the word “horse.” Very likely the visual
image of a horse arises in mind. This image,
idea, notion, “concept,” will depend on your experience
of par­tic­u­lar horses. It will never be
a logical abstract of these. It will never be a
horse without color, par­tic­u­lar size, sex or
breed, as is sometimes thought. It may however
have different elements in it from different
horses you have seen. It may be the image of
just one par­tic­u­lar horse you remember. But
no such thing as a general concept exists in the
mind. We have a par­tic­u­lar image which stands
for all horses. The name of course is general.
It—or its definition—may be called the
logical concept. But the name itself is not used
in thought. It is an arbitrary symbol which
serves merely to arouse a par­tic­u­lar image associated
with it, and this image is dealt with as if
general. This image we shall call the concept.
It is the working concept: the psy­cho­log­i­cal as
opposed to the logical concept.</p>

<p>As your concept of a horse will depend on
your experience of par­tic­u­lar horses, another
person’s concept will depend on <i>his</i> experience
of that animal. And as his experience can
never be exactly the same as yours, his concept,
though it may be similar to yours, will not be
the same. Not only will no one else have the
same mental image or concept as you <i>but you
yourself will never have exactly the same image
twice</i>. This image will vary with the setting in
which it occurs—with the associates which happen
to arouse it. If you are reading about a
great battle and the word “horse” is mentioned,
a certain kind of horse will suggest itself to you.
If you are reading about a grocery wagon and
see the word “horse” another kind will suggest
itself. This whether the animal is described by
adjectives or not. At one time you may think
of the horse as in motion, at another time as at
rest.</p>

<p>Unfortunately many so-called psychologists
seem to consider the concept, even this image-concept,
as something fixed in the individual, or
at best as only changing with actual experience
of the thing conceived. The truth is that the
image or images aroused on hearing any word
are not the same for two seconds at a time.
They are fluid, dynamic; never static, immobile.
They are associates of the words in a constant
state of flux.<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn22" id="fnanc22">22</a> When the concept of one individual
varies from one moment to the next, how
must the concepts of different individuals differ
from each other!</p>

<p>I have instanced the idea of a horse because it
is so simple and concrete. In actual thinking
we never meet with a simple separated concept
or with a single word; we deal with at least an
entire sentence. This means that our images
vary even more widely at different times than
was the case in the example. It means that the
images of other people are at a cor­res­pond­ingly
greater variance from ours.</p>

<p>As to the application of all this to writing.
We have an idea; thinking it important we decide
to jot it down. Now we cannot jot down
the idea, but only words associated with it. We
cannot even write all the words associated with
it, for there are too many. So we write a comparative
few; and we say we have written the
idea. <i>But all we have really written is something
associated with the idea.</i> When we read
this over at a later time we shall not have
the same ideas aroused as were in mind
originally, but at best only similar ideas. For the
associates of words, like all associates, are constantly
changing; and thanks to the frailties of
human memory exactly the same associates are
never aroused twice. So after a long interval
they will be much different than at the time we
wrote. The reader will often have the experience
of “writing a thought” and thinking it
very important, but on reading it at another
time he will fail to see why he ever considered
it worth putting on paper. The truth is that
at the time he wrote the idea it probably <i>was</i>
important, because he had the right concepts.
But when he came back to the words he had
written they failed to re-suggest the former concepts
and associates.</p>

<p>This difference between words and thought is
even more strikingly brought out when the written
thought is read by some other person than
the writer. The writer is likely at least to have
approximately the same concepts as at the time
of writing. And he is greatly aided by his memory
in recalling the concepts and associated
ideas previously in mind, the words suggesting
these. But when a person reads what some one
else has written, he translates the words into
the concepts previously connected with them in
his own mind. Thus an author can never literally
transfer an idea. He can merely put down
certain arbitrary symbols, which will serve to
arouse a similar thought in his readers. How
greatly the reader’s thought differs from the author’s
it is dif­fi­cult if not im­pos­sible to de­termine,
for minds can only com­mun­i­cate by words.
It is this dif­fer­ence in as­soc­iated con­cept which
often makes a reader fail to ap­prec­iate the pro­foundest
thoughts of an author, and even, on the
other hand, oc­ca­sionally to see depth where it
does not exist.</p>

<p>We come now to the solution of the problem
to which this rather extended discussion has
been preparatory. How is an author to convey,
as nearly as possible, his actual idea? And the
answer is: <i>he should word it in as many different
ways as possible</i>.</p>

<p>If a person had never been to a city and you
wanted to give him an idea of it, you would
show him photographs taken from different
viewpoints. One photograph would correct and
supplement the other. And the more
photographic viewpoints he saw the more complete
and accurate would be his idea—the more his
concept would approximate the actual city. But
he could never more than approximate; he could
never obtain the idea of a man who had visited
that city.</p>

<p>An author’s language is a photograph of his
thought. He can never actually transfer an
idea, but by wording it in different ways he can
show different photographs of it.</p>

<p>If, for example, a second wording does not
conform with the first concept which a reader
has formed, the reader will be obliged to modify
that concept. And if the idea is repeated in a
number of different ways he will have to modify
his concept so much that he will gradually more
and more approximate the idea of the author.</p>

<p>I remember the story in some educational
treatise of an inspector who entered a school
room, asked the teacher what she had been giving
her class, and finally took up a book and
asked the following question, “If you were to
dig a hole thousands and thousands of feet deep,
would it be cooler near the bottom or near the
top, and why?” Not a child answered.
Finally the teacher said, “I’m sure they know
the answer but I don’t think you put the question
in the right way.” So taking the book she
asked, “In what state is the center of the
earth?” Immediately came the reply from the
whole class in chorus, “The center of the earth
is in a state of <i>igneous fusion</i>.”&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>There is, and has been for the past generation,
a great cry in educational circles that we should
teach things, not words. In some instances this
is inadvisable, even impracticable. But if the
teacher in the foregoing story had taken the
trouble to word her idea in at least more than
one way, she might have implanted a real idea in
her pupils. She would at least have found that
as it was they had none.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>One more question remains. If you are writing
a composition, a letter, an essay, or even
a book, what is the best way to get down all
your thoughts, without losing any of value; to
get them down in the best order and in the best
style? In other words what is the path of greatest
efficiency in transferring thoughts from your
mind to paper?</p>

<p>We have already considered such devices as
shorthand. Of course dictation, where it is possible,
is an obvious advantage. But I mean
here to consider the aspects of the problem
which apply more especially to compositions of
some length.</p>

<p>It is related of Auguste Comte that he composed
his books by thinking them over down to
the minutest details, down to the very phraseology
of the sentences, before penning a single
word, but that when he came to writing he could
turn out an astounding amount of work in a
given time. Unless a person have a remarkable
memory, however, he will forget most of what
he has thought by the time he comes to writing
it. Comte’s method might nevertheless be
profitably applied to short sections of compositions.
And where conciseness or perspicuity
are desired, it will often be found useful to think
out an entire sentence before writing a word
of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way of ensuring efficiency in
writing is by the card system. This consists in
writing on a separate card every valuable idea
that occurs to you, immediately after it occurs.
When you finally come to writing you can arrange
these cards in any order desired, throwing
out the ideas you no longer consider important,
and adding those which are necessary to
complete or round out the work.</p>

THINGS WORTH THINKING ABOUT</span></h2>

<p class="pepigraph">
The man who cannot wonder, who does not habitually
wonder, is but a pair of spectacles behind which
there is no eye.—<span class="smcap">Carlyle.</span></p>

<p class="pfirst">Up to now I have treated exclusively of <i>how</i>
to think, but have made no mention of
<i>what</i> to think. I have treated of the best methods
of dealing with different subjects and questions;
I have not considered what subjects or
problems are most worth dealing with.</p>

<p>Of course the important thing is that you
do think. It is not absolutely essential that the
results of your thinking are results which can
be directly made use of. Thinking is an end
in itself. Most men imagine that “thinking for
the sake of thinking” may appeal to philosophers,
but means nothing to them, as they like
to think only when by so doing they can forward
some practical end. These people do
themselves an injustice.</p>

<p>Perhaps you, O reader, are among them. If
so, let me appeal to your personal experience.
Have you ever tried to solve a toy puzzle, tried
to take the two wire hooks apart without bending
them? Or have you ever stopped to tackle
a problem on the family page of your evening
or Sunday newspaper? “A grocer buys fifteen
dozen eggs, he sells—” you know what I mean.
You admit that you have. Exactly. You have
been thinking for the mere sake of thinking.</p>

<p>If you protest that you didn’t care about the
thinking, that you took no pleasure in the thinking,
which was merely incidental, but that
what really urged you on and gave you pleasure
was the solution of the puzzle, you are
again deceiving yourself. The thinking was not
incidental. Thinking and problem solving are
identical. The fact is that you set yourself to
solving a problem, to removing a mental hindrance,
for the mere sake of getting the answer,
with absolutely no thought of what you were going
to do with the answer when you got it.</p>

<p>But if you can derive so much pleasure from
thinking which you cannot put to use, how much
greater should be your pleasure when your
conclusions can be utilized? For when you think
of something useful, you have not only the present
pleasure of solving your problem, but the
ulterior pleasure of applying your solution to
action, or to the solution of some further problem.
And while I again admit that thinking is
an end in itself, this does not prevent it from
being at the same time a means to some further
end. After all is said there is really no reason
why we should be prejudiced against problems
or subjects that are useful.</p>

<p>The mere decision that we should think of
useful questions is insufficient. Very few questions
are without <i>some</i> use. Even the solution
of the family page puzzle might some day be
useful in solving a similar problem arising in
your own business; and even if this never came
to pass you might spring the puzzle on your
friends, and make yourself socially more interesting.
Thought given to a question in a debating
book now before me, “Resolved, that
Ferocious Wild Beasts are more to be dreaded
than Venomous Reptiles,” might result in
knowledge which would come handy in selecting
equipment if one decided to journey to the
wilderness of South America. But there are
millions of problems of as much use as these;
and it is not within the power of one lone mortal,
of years three score and ten, to compass
even a corner of them. Our question is not—what
problems are of use?, but—of <i>how much</i>
use are certain problems?, or stated in another
way,—what is the <i>relative</i> utility of problems?</p>

<p>Any adequate con­si­der­a­tion of this question
would involve the selection of some criterion for
utility, and the testing of individual problems
by that criterion. But to treat such a question
with anything like justice is beyond the scope of
this book; it would require almost a volume in
itself. It is almost the same as the problem,
What knowledge is of most worth?, and the most
masterly treatise on that question which has
ever been written can be found in Herbert Spencer’s
epoch-making little work, <i>Education</i>. I
sincerely hope that the reader study this. But
I hope even more earnestly that before he does
so he first think the problem out in­de­pen­dently,
for it is one of the most important he can put
before himself.</p>

<p>But our present question—that of the relative
importance of problems—is slightly different
from that of the relative importance of knowledge.
The first deals with thought and the
second with information, or the materials of
thought; the first with a process of getting
knowledge and the second with knowledge itself.</p>

<p>I believe for example that a knowledge of his
own body and of the laws of health is the most
valuable a man can have, but there are few
problems concerning the body which I would include
in the first rank. There are several reasons
for this. In the first place, while it may
be true that such questions <i>taken as a whole</i>
are more important than any other class of
questions, taken separately they are relatively
minor; there are no one or two questions of all-encompassing
importance to which all the others
are subsidiary. Moreover, such questions,
while they undoubtedly require thought for their
solution, depend to a relatively great extent on
observation and experiment. No sane medical
student would sit down and follow out a lengthy
course of reasoning as to where the heart is;
he would merely observe or dissect, or consult
the book of a man who had dissected, and save
mental fatigue. Not least of all, questions of
physiology require extensive, highly technical
and detailed information—information which
requires years of special study to acquire—before
any thinking that is at all safe can be put
upon them. So in estimating the relative value
of problems, there are other con­si­der­a­tions besides
the value of knowledge.</p>

<p>But it is not my purpose here to discuss the
general principles upon which the selection of
worth-while questions should be made. That
task I leave to the reader. I have chosen rather
the concrete path of suggesting a list of questions
which I consider of great import. I believe
that no matter how much thought the
reader gives to any one of them he will not be
losing his time.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere pointed out that the more
knowledge a man has the more problems he will
have. It is equally true that unless a man has
some knowledge on a subject he will not be able
to appreciate or even understand some of its
most important problems. It is only when we
begin to think of subjects that we discover problems
and realize their significance. In stating
most of the following problems, therefore, I
have often thought it necessary to add a few
sentences in explanation, and have sometimes
stated a question in a variety of forms in order
to more clearly convey the thought.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p><i>Are specific char­ac­ter­is­tics, acquired during
the life­time of an in­di­vi­dual, in­herited by his
off­spring?</i> I have re­ferred so often to this
problem and its im­por­tance that further ex­pla­na­tion
is hardly nec­es­sary. “Char­ac­ter­is­tics”
of course refer to in­tel­lec­tual and moral
as well as physical char­ac­ter­is­tics.</p>

<p><i>What is the influence of the individual mind
on society and of social environment on the individual?</i></p>

<p><i>Does the form of government determine the
character of a people, or does the character of a
people determine their form of government?</i>
Or do government and character react on each
other, and how? The same question may be
asked of all other social institutions. Does
the religion of a people determine their character,
or does the character of a people determine
their religion? This whole problem is
somewhat similar to that immediately preceding, regarding
the interaction of the individual and the
social mind.</p>

<p><i>Is society for the benefit of the individual or
is the individual for the benefit of society?</i></p>

<p><i>Should the jurisdiction of the government be
extended or curtailed?</i> Or should it be extended
in some directions and curtailed in others?
Does the answer to this problem depend
on the answer to the previous one? Another
form of the same problem is: What is the
proper sphere of government?</p>

<p><i>Should the government grant monopolies?</i>
Patents, for example?</p>

<p><i>What would be the most practicable plan for
abolishing or minimizing war?</i> Those who do
not wish to beg the previous question may first
ask whether it is always desirable to prevent
war, whether war is always an evil. What is
the effect of war on the physical future of the
race? on national and individual character? on
government? on national liberty? on personal
liberty? What are the ethics of war? for aggression?
for territorial conquest? for “national
honor”? for defense of a weaker nation? for
defense against invasion? What is the ef­fect of
pre­pared­ness? of un­i­versal pre­pared­ness? of
pre­pared­ness of an in­di­vi­dual nation? In each
case what are the principles on which the extent
of pre­pared­ness should be de­termined? What
are the fun­da­men­tal causes of war? How can
they be removed? Is it pos­sible to remove all of
them?</p>

<p><i>Which is the rightful owner of land, the community
or the individual?</i> To state the problem
in another form: Should private land ownership
be abolished?</p>

<p><i>Who should be entitled to vote?</i> This of
course is a question similar to woman suffrage,
but it is much broader. It deals not only with
the qualification of sex, but of age. Should any
one under twenty-one have the vote? The validity
of property and educational qualifications
should also be considered.</p>

<p><i>How should the relations of the sexes be regulated?</i>
Put in slightly narrower and perhaps
less objectionable form: What would be just
laws governing marriage and divorce?</p>

<p><i>What is the effect of attempted State interference
with the law of supply and demand?</i>
Does the un­re­strict­ed working out of this law
forward ultimate justice? Just what is the validity
and the meaning of the expression “The
<i>law</i> of supply and demand”? The question
could be taken up in connection with minimum
wage laws, railroad rate regulations, “extra
crew” laws, etc.</p>

<p><i>Which is the best policy: free trade, rev­enue
tar­iff, or pro­tec­tive tar­iff?</i> Or under what con­ditions
is each best? With what classes of com­mo­dities?</p>

<p><i>What would be an equitable and sound currency
system?</i> This question is somewhat
technical, and would have to be considered in
the form of a number of subsidiary problems.
Ought money to have an intrinsic value? What
is the effect of “fiat” paper currency on money
of intrinsic value and on prices? The effect of
credit? The effect of fluctuations in the supply
of gold? Ought there be a double standard or
a multiple standard? etc.</p>

<p><i>Should conduct be judged by the pleasure or
happiness it yields?</i> Stated in another form, almost
a different problem: Is utility a good
moral guide?</p>

<p><i>Should conduct be judged by its tendency to
produce individual well-being, or should it be
judged by its tendency to produce the well-being
of all humanity, or of all sentient beings?</i> This
problem cannot be lightly dismissed in favor
of universal well-being. This becomes apparent
when we attempt to give an undogmatic and
non-question-begging answer to the query:
Why should a man act for the benefit of others?</p>

<p>No science is more provocative of thought
than ethics. The question of whether acts
should be declared good or bad as they tend to
produce pleasure or happiness, either individual
or in humanity as a whole, or whether “virtue”
or “morality” is an end in itself, is one
of the most subtle and elusive we can attempt
to solve; no matter which answer we give we
are brought into logical and psy­cho­log­i­cal dilemmas
from which it seems impossible to escape.
This is also true of the problem of
whether our knowledge of what constitutes right
and wrong comes from experience or from intuition.</p>

<p>The broadest form of the ethical problem,
which includes the two preceding italicized problems,
is:</p>

<p><i>What is the proper criterion for determining
right and wrong conduct?</i> Or even less dogmatic:
Can there be a criterion for determining
right and wrong conduct, and what is it?</p>

<p>Somewhat allied with the ethical problem is
that problem of problems: how to live? By this
is meant how to put the most into life and get
the most out of it; what vocation to follow; what
hobbies, amusements, avocations to take up;
how to plan time by months, by weeks, by days,
by hours. How much time and energy do certain
activities deserve? How much can we afford
to give them? Restated: what activities
are of most worth?</p>

<p>Of course every one does think of problems
connected with the art of living. But he thinks
of them as little unconnected questions. Barely
indeed does any one go about the solution of
the general problem of living in an orderly,
sys­tem­at­ic manner. To insist upon the broad
practical bearings of the problem would be unnecessary,
absurd. By its very nature it is the
most “practical” question we can ask. Any
par­tic­u­lar solution or treatment may be impractical,
but this does not affect the question itself.</p>

<p><i>What are the respective influences of environment
(education, experience, etc.) and innate
tendencies in determining character?</i> Which is
the greater determinant?</p>

<p><i>Does pleasure depend upon the satisfaction
of instinctive desires, or do desires for certain
activities depend upon the pleasure accompanying
the previous performance of such activities?</i>
Does an activity or the possession of an
object give us pleasure because we have previously
desired it, or do we desire an activity
or an object because we have previously obtained
pleasure from it? Or do pleasure and
desire interact, and just how? The solution of
this psy­cho­log­i­cal problem is of tremendous importance
in ethics.</p>

<p><i>Does the mind depend entirely on the brain?</i>
That is, are all thoughts, emotions, feelings,
due to material changes in the brain? The answer
we give to this problem may determine our
answer to the question of immortality.</p>

<p><i>What knowledge is of most worth?</i> I have
so fully discussed the importance of this
question and the method of proceeding with its solution
that further explanation is needless.</p>

<p>One sphere of thought where the thinker is
compelled to be original; where it is practically
impossible for him to fall into beaten tracks, is
invention. But there is useless as well as useful
invention. A man’s ambition may range
all the way from inventing a machine to harness
directly the limitless power of the sun, down
to devising a tenacious tip for shoelaces. But
he should be careful about inventing something
already patented. He should be even more
careful to avoid inventing something for which
there is no demand. One of Edison’s first
patents was for a machine to register quickly
the votes of legislative assemblies. And it
worked. But the legislative assemblies didn’t
want it, because they didn’t want their votes
quickly registered. That would have ended
good old filibuster methods. Another invention
of great uselessness which has been several
times attempted is a machine to write words just
like the human hand writes them. There are
really so many useful things which do not exist
and for which there is a demand, that it seems
quite a pity nine out of ten patents in the files
at Washington are for things inutile. If the
would-be inventor cannot himself think of something
really needed, almost any big patent attorney
house will send him an entire book of
sug­ges­tions on “What to Invent.”</p>

<p>Invention usually requires highly technical
knowledge, not to speak of facilities for experiment
and a well-supplied purse. But nothing
gives more solid satisfaction to its creator than
a successful appliance. While the conscientious
philosopher is constantly harassed by doubts as
to whether, after all, he has discovered truth;
the inventor need not worry. His machine
either works or it does not work, and he <i>knows</i>
the truth of his thought thereby. On the other
hand the philosopher will always have <i>some</i>
thoughts. Be they true or not they may at least
be interesting and worth recording, whereas the
inventor may toil on for years and years with
absolutely nothing to show for his exertion at
the end.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>There are a number of problems that are not
of great “practical” importance, but whose
theoretic value is so transcendent as to compel
attention. Among these are certain problems in
psychology, but more especially in metaphysics,
philosophy and even religion, insofar as religion
can be said to have problems.</p>

<p><i>Is there a God and is it possible for man to
learn anything of His nature?</i> Some readers
may object to the first part of this question.
But I state it because I am anxious to avoid
dogmatism.</p>

<p><i>Is the soul immortal?</i> What do we mean by
the soul? Does science disprove the life after
death?</p>

<p><i>What is the test of truth?</i> How shall we
know truth when we have it? What after all is
“truth”?</p>

<p><i>Are our wills free, or are our actions pre­de­ter­mined?</i> Some may
object to this way of stating the question. Much confusion exists as to
the meaning of the problem. A different way of stating it would lead
to different treatment. What is the “will”? What do we mean by “free”?
What do we mean by “pre­de­ter­mined”?</p>

<p><i>The problem of existence.</i> How did the universe
come into being? This is the last
problem in which interest can be stimulated from
without. No matter in how many different
ways he phrases it, a writer cannot convey this
sense of mystery to another. It must arise from
within. Most of the time we accept, we take for
granted, the universe and the existent order of
things, and it requires the greatest effort to keep
alive our mystification and doubt for even short
periods.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>The list of questions foregoing is of course
merely suggestive. It is impossible to select,
say twenty-five questions, and pronounce them
the twenty-five most important that can be
asked. I fully realize there are questions of
greater importance than some I have propounded.
But I have not gone so far as to advise
that every one of these should be thought
over. The list has been given merely for
thought stimulation, and to indicate what is
meant by “worth while” questions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have not been able to explain
why most of these are so important. To have
done so would have required too much time for
each individual problem. It would have drawn
us too far out of our subject. The reader must
find out or sense the importance for himself.</p>

<p>Practically all of the problems given in the
list come under one of the sciences, especially if
we count metaphysics or philosophy as a science,
which it is in so far as it is organized knowledge.
This may seem somewhat narrow. Now
I admit there are important problems which are
not included in any science. But there are very
few. As soon as deep thought is given to a
problem its treatment becomes sys­tem­at­ic. It
either falls into one of the sciences or a new
science evolves about it. John Stuart Mill once
started a journal in which he promised himself
to put one thought a day, but he did not permit
himself to record there any thought on a problem
falling within one of the special sciences.
None of the thoughts he put in the journal is of
any great value. It came to an abrupt end in
about two months.</p>

<p>It may be objected that though the questions
selected are most important <i>in themselves</i>, there
are other things more worth thinking about, because
of the mental discipline they yield. Now
putting aside the fact that questions important
in themselves should be dealt with ultimately—that
mental discipline would be useless unless
applied to important problems—I must voice my
suspicion that the most useful questions are also
the best for training the mind. It may be true
that punching the bag will help a prizefighter in
boxing. But other things equal, a man who has
spent one week in actual boxing is better prepared
to enter the prize ring than one who has
devoted a month to bag punching. The best
practice for boxing is boxing. The best practice
for solving important questions is solving
important questions.</p>

<p>Nor do I admit the contention is valid that
one problem rather than another should be
thought of because it is “deeper.” We cannot
truthfully say that psychology is a “deeper”
science than ethics, or that metaphysics is deeper
than psychology, or vice versa. Most subjects
and most problems are just as deep as we care
to make them. Their depth depends entirely on
how deep we go into them. This applies especially
to the so-called philosophical sciences.
We may give them shallow treatment or we may
give them profound treatment. But we shall
usually find that the deepest questions are the
most important questions. For the most important
questions have generally attracted the
greatest minds; consequently they have been
given the deepest treatment; and when a man
reads the attempted solutions of these great
minds his thoughts tend toward this deeper
plane. Of course certain problems, especially
in mathematics, can be dealt with by only one
method. In this case we may properly speak
of some problems being objectively deeper or at
least more difficult than others.</p>

<p>Some objections may be offered to several of
the questions in my list, on the ground that they
are invalid. Such problems as the immortality
of the soul and the problem of existence may be
declared inscrutable, unsolvable. Such a problem
as “Is society for the benefit of the individual
or is the individual for the benefit of society?”
may be said to imply that society is
something which has been voluntarily formed
like the State. It may be declared that this is
not the case; it may be objected that this question
is meaningless. All these objections may
be justified. But their truth cannot be
determined until we actually attempt a solution.
The determination of the validity of a problem
is part of the problem.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>We come now to the question of what is most
worth reading. The simplest answer is that
that is most worth reading which is most worth
thinking about, and therefore we should read
those books which deal with such problems as I
have indicated. But this counsel needs to be
supplemented.</p>

<p>A conservative estimate places the number of
books in the world at 4,500,000. (This estimate
was made before the war broke out, and the
war-books by now have doubtless brought the
number to 5,000,000.) This does not mean
books as collections of printed sheets of paper
bound together—books as physical objects—for
if it did the number would be immensely
greater. It means 4,500,000 (or more) separate
and distinct treatises. If you were to read one
book every two weeks, you would read about
twenty-five a year, and if you read for fifty
years you would cover 1,250. One book in every
three thousand six hundred! (3,600!)</p>

<p>From this it is apparent that even the most
omnivorous reader, even the reader who can
cover a book swiftly by efficient skipping, will
at least have to ask himself before beginning a
volume, “Is this a book in a thousand? Can I
afford to read this at the cost of missing nine
hundred and ninety-nine others?” And most
men who ask this question will have to substitute
the number five thousand, or even ten thousand.</p>

<p>Nine-tenths of our reading is on mere chance
recommendation, passing whim or by sheer accident.
We catch sight of a book on a library
table. Having nothing better to do we pick it
up; we start perusing it. Every book read in
this way means a sinful waste of time. To be
sure, a book read in this chance manner <i>might</i>
(accidentally) be very good—even better than
some you would have planned for; but this will
happen seldom, and is never a justification of
the practice. By going a round about way to
a place a man might stumble across a lost pocketbook,
but this would not justify taking round
about ways.</p>

<p>The first thing needed, then, is that we should
plan our reading. Perhaps the best way to do
this would be to make out a list of the books we
intend to read for the coming year, or say a list
of from a dozen to twenty-five volumes, and
then read them in the order listed. Another
good plan is to jot down the title of every book
we intend to read, and keep the list about with
us. Then when we meet with a book which we
think would be good to read, or which we feel
we simply must read, we can before starting it
glance at our list. The formidable array we
find there will probably induce us either to give
up entirely our intention to read the book before
us, or at least to put it somewhere on the
list which will allow more important books to
be read first.</p>

<p>Some people cannot endure planning their
reading in this manner. It grates on them to
think they are tied down to any sort of program;
it seems to deprive them of the advantages
of spontaneous interest. Well, if you cannot
plan your reading prospectively, at least
plan it retro­spec­tive­ly. If you cannot keep a
list of books you <i>intend</i> to read, at least keep a
list of books you <i>have</i> read. Refer to this from
time to time. See whether you have been reading
uniformly good literature. See whether you
have been reading too much on one topic and not
enough on another, and what topics you have
been long neglecting. But at best this method
is a poor substitute for planning your reading
prospectively.</p>

<p>We should plan not only with regard to topics
and subjects, but with regard to authors. Obviously
if two men of equal ability both study
the same subject, one will get more out of his
study than the other if he reads authors who
treat the subject on a deeper plane—provided of
course he understands them.</p>

<p>Whether consciously or not, we tend to imitate
the authors we read. If we read shallow
books we are forced, while reading them, to do
shallow thinking. Our plane of thought tends
toward the plane of thought of the authors we
study; we acquire either habits of careful critical
thinking, or of dogmatic lack of thinking.</p>

<p>This emphasizes the importance of reading
the best books, and <i>only</i> the best books. Our
plane of thinking is determined not alone by
the good books we read, but by all the books
we read; it tends toward the <i>average</i>. Most
men imagine that when they read a good book
they get a certain amount of good out of it, and
that this good will stay with them undiminished.
Provided they read a certain number of serious
books, they see no reason why they should not
read any number of superficial or useless books,
or any amount of ephemeral magazine or newspaper
literature. They expect the serious reading
to benefit them. They do not expect the
shallow reading to harm them. This is just as
if they were to buy and eat unnutritious and indigestible
food, and excuse themselves on the
ground that they ate nourishing and digestible
food along with it.</p>

<p>The analogy may be carried further. As it is
the average of the physical food you digest
which ultimately determines the constitution of
your body, so it is the average of the mental
food you absorb which determines the constitution
of your mind. One good meal will not offset
a week of bad ones; one good book will never
offset any number of poor books. Further, as
no one has a perfect memory, you do not retain
all you read any more than you retain all you
eat. Therefore if you do not want your mind
to retrogress, you should not rest satisfied with
books already read, but should continue to read
books at least as good as any previous. As at
any given time your bodily health—so far as it
depends on food—is mainly determined by the
meals of the last few days or weeks, so is your
mental health dependent on the last few books
you have read.</p>

<p>One of the first things we should look to in
selecting books is their comp­re­hen­sive­ness.
To quote Arnold Bennett: “Unless and until
a man has formed a scheme of knowledge, be it
but a mere skeleton, his reading must necessarily
be un­phi­lo­soph­i­cal. He must have attained
to some notion of the inter­re­la­tions of the
various branches of knowledge before he can
properly comprehend the branch of knowledge
in which he specializes.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn23" id="fnanc23">23</a> As an aid in forming
this scheme of knowledge, Mr. Bennett suggests
Herbert Spencer’s <i>First Principles</i>. I
heartily endorse his choice. I would add to it
the essay on <i>The Clas­si­fi­ca­tion of the Sciences</i>
by the same author.</p>

<p>These works are classics, and one of the most
regrettable of difficulties is that of getting people
to read the classics. Mention to a man Darwin’s
<i>Origin of Species</i> or <i>Descent of Man</i>, and
he will reply, “Oh, yes, that’s the theory that
says men descended from monkeys.” Satisfied
that he knows all there is to know about it, he
never reads any of Darwin’s works. Now
passing over the fact that the theory does not
assert that man descended from monkeys and
never intended to assert it;—what a compliment
to Darwin’s thought and brevity to assume that
all his books can be summed up in a phrase!
But Darwin is not the only sufferer. If we
come across the title of a classic often enough,
and hear a lot of talk “about it and about” and
a few quotations from it, we gradually come to
believe we know all the contents worth knowing.
This is why Shakespeare, and in fact most
of the classics, are so seldom actually read, and
why we go for our serious reading to a book on
“How to Read Character from Handwriting”
or to a sensational volume on prostitution by
one of our modern “sociologists.” The only
way we can keep ourselves from such stuff is to
lay out some definite end, some big objective,
to be attained; and before reading a book we
should ask how that helps us to attain it.</p>

<p>I have not given a formal list of books worth
reading, nor do I intend to; one of the reasons
being that the work has been done so well
by others. Ever since Sir John Lubbock published
his list of one hundred best books, the
number of selections has been legion. Charles
Eliot’s selection for his <i>Five Foot Shelf</i> is to
be commended, and a little volume by Frank
Parsons <i>The World’s Best Books</i>. Of course
our purpose is special:—to find the best books
for making thinkers; but the remarks already
made should aid the reader sufficiently in making
his own selection from these lists. As previously
pointed out, if the reader is studying a
specialty he can usually find a fairly well selected
bibliography at the end of the article on
that specialty in any standard encyclopedia.</p>

<hr class="hrblk">

<p>The reader probably sees clearly by now
that it is impossible to do his own thinking in
every case; that if he is to have sound knowledge
on important questions he must have the
courage to be ignorant of many things. How
much trouble to go to in any par­tic­u­lar case it
is difficult to say.</p>

<p>We can lay it down as a general principle that
questions of the highest importance, such as
those of which I have given a suggestive list—questions
which deal with facts known or easily
ascertainable, and which depend for their right
solution more on thinking than on anything
else—a man should solve for himself, and
should take the greatest caution in so doing.
On the other hand, questions of the highest importance
which depend for their solution mainly
on full and detailed knowledge of highly technical
facts which lie outside of one’s specialty,
should be dealt with by consulting authorities
and taking their word for it.</p>

<p>There still remains the great mass of questions
which are relatively unimportant, but continually
coming up in our daily life, the answers
to which greatly influence our conduct.
Time forbids us not only from thinking these
out for ourselves, but even from consulting an
authority—for the selection of an authority
often involves almost as much in­tel­lec­tual
responsibility as self-thinking. The only thing
we can do is to accept the verdict of popular
opinion.</p>

<p>Custom, convention and popular belief, no
matter how many times they have been overthrown,
have fairly reliable foundations. Popular
ideas, to be sure, are products of mere unorganized
experience. They are empirical; seldom
if ever scientific. But though they are
founded on experience which is <i>unorganized</i>,
they are founded on so much of it that they are
worthy of respect. Society could not long exist
if it persisted in acting on beliefs altogether
wrong, though it is safe to say that popular
ideas are never more than approximately right.
But unless and until you have either thoroughly
thought over a question for yourself or have
consulted an acknowledged and trustworthy authority,
it is best tentatively to accept and act
on common belief. To think and act differently,
merely for the sake of being different, is unprofitable
and dangerous, all questions of ethics
aside.</p>

THINKING AS AN ART</span></h2>

<p class="pepigraph">
I discovered, though unconsciously and insensibly,
that the pleasure of observing and reasoning was a
much higher one than that of skill and sport.—<span class="smcap">Darwin’s</span>
<i>Autobiography</i>.</p>

<p class="pfirst">To know is one thing; to do another. To
know the sci­ence of thinking is not to pos­sess
the art of think­ing. Yet I doubt not that
there are readers who having finished, would
deem it sufficient that they had the knowledge,
and would feel they had gotten all the good or
harm out of this book that there is in it. They
would put it aside. They would think no more
of it.</p>

<p>The trouble with these good people (unfortunately
I speak of the overwhelming majority)
is that they expect information to apply itself.
They expect that once they have learnt a thing
they will act according to their knowledge.
This is the very last thing a normal human being
does.</p>

<p>The only way we can ever get ourselves to
apply knowledge is to do so by what will at first
be a conscious effort. We shall have to devote
much attention to it. Old established custom
will have to be broken. We do not act according
to knowledge; we act according to habit. Even
after we have decided, for instance, that we
ought to give a little in­de­pen­dent thinking to a
subject before reading about it, we shall very
likely continue to read books without previous
thought.</p>

<p>Some people may imagine that the reason we
do not practice what we learn is that we do not
remember what we learn. They are mistaken.
When learning German, I had much difficulty in
knowing what prepositions required the genitive,
dative or accusative cases. I finally learnt
all of them alphabetically in their respective
groups, and could rattle them off at a rate which
would make most native Germans blush for
envy. The only trouble was that when I came
to an actual sentence requiring one of these
prepositions I continually forgot to apply my
knowledge. Some one would have to point an
error out to me before it would occur to me to
do so. Even then I would have to think long
before the proper case occurred.</p>

<p>But while it is not true that we fail to practice
a thing merely because we fail to remember
it, it is true that if we do not practice we are
not very likely to remember it. The only way
we could remember would be by constant re-reading,
for knowledge unused tends to drop out
of mind. Knowledge used does not need to be
remembered; practice forms habits and habits
make memory unnecessary. The rule is nothing;
the application is everything.</p>

<p>Practice being the thing needful, it is essential
that we put aside a certain amount of time for
it. Unless you lay out a definite program, unless
you put aside, say, one-half hour every day,
for pure downright in­de­pen­dent thinking, you
will probably neglect to practice at all. One-half
hour out of every twenty-four seems little
enough. You may think you can fit it in with
no trouble. But no matter how shamelessly you
have been putting in your time, you have been
doing <i>something</i> with it. In order to get in
your thirty minutes of thinking, you will have
to put aside something which has been habitually
taking up a half hour of your day. You cannot
expect simply to add thinking to your other activities.
Some other activity must be cut down
or cut out.<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn24" id="fnanc24">24</a></p>

<p>You may think me quite lenient in advising
only one-half hour a day. You may even go so
far as to say that one-half hour a day is not
enough. Perhaps it isn’t. But I am par­tic­u­larly
anxious to have some of the advice in this
book followed. And I greatly fear that if I advised
more than a half hour most readers would
serenely neglect my advice altogether. After
you have been able for a month to devote at least
one-half hour a day to thinking, you may then,
if you choose, extend the time. But if you attempt
to do too much at once, you may find it so
inconvenient, if not impracticable, that you may
give up attempting altogether. Throughout
the book I have constantly kept in mind that I
wish my advice followed. I have therefore laid
down rules which may reasonably be adhered to
by an average human, rules which do not require
a hardened asceticism to apply, and rules which
have occasionally been followed by the author
himself. In this last respect, I flatter myself,
the present differs from most books of advice.</p>

<p>Above all I urge the reader to avoid falling
into that habit so prevalent and at the same time
so detrimental to character:—acquiescing in advice
and not following it. You should view
critically every sentence in this book. Wherever
you find any advice which you think needless,
or which requires unnecessary sacrifice to
put into practice, or is wrong, you should so
mark it. And you should think out for yourself
what would be the best practice to follow.
But when you agree with any advice you see
here, you should make it your business to follow
it. The fact that part of the advice may be
wrong is no reason why you should not follow
the part that is right.</p>

<p>Most people honestly intend to follow advice,
and actually start to do it, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They try
to practice everything at once. As a result they
end by practicing nothing. The secret of practice
is to learn thoroughly one thing at a time.
As already stated, we act according to habit.
The only way to break an old habit or to form a
new one is to give our whole attention to the
process. The new action will soon require less
and less attention, until finally we shall do it
automatically, without thought—in short, we
shall have formed another habit. This accomplished
we can turn to still others.</p>

<p>As an example let us take the different
methods of looking at questions considered in
the second chapter. Most readers will glance
over these methods, and agree that they are very
helpful—and the next problem which perplexes
them will probably be solved by no method at
all, or will be looked at from one standpoint
only.</p>

<p>About the best, perhaps the only way by which
the reader could get himself to use habitually
every valuable method possible, would be to take
one of the methods, say the evolutionary, and
consciously apply it, or attempt to apply it, to
a whole list of problems. In this way he could
learn the possibilities and limits of that par­tic­u­lar
method. Again, he could take an individual
problem and consciously attempt to apply every
possible method to its solution. He could continue
such practice until he had so formed the
habit of using method that it would be employed
almost unconsciously. Con­cen­tra­tion, meth­od
in book read­ing, and all the other prac­tices here
ad­vocated should be learned in the same conscious,
pain­staking way, one thing at a time,
until thoroughly ingrained. It must be left to
the reader’s own ingenuity to devise the best
methods of acquiring each par­tic­u­lar habit.</p>

<p>Of course it is possible to do a thing well—it
is possible to follow the rule for doing it—without
knowing the rule. If a man take a live
interest in a subject he will naturally tend to
look at it from a number of different viewpoints.
If he be eternally on the lookout for errors and
fallacies in his own thinking he will gradually
evolve a logic of his own. And this logic will
be concrete, not abstract; it will be something
built into, an integral part of, concrete thought,
and he will be constantly strengthening the
habit of using it. Compared with the logic of
the books it may be crude, but it will not consist
of mere rules, which can be recited but which
are seldom applied.</p>

<p>So with grammar. Instance the writer’s experience
with German. Few native Germans
could recite offhand what prepositions govern
the genitive, dative and accusative, even if they
knew what was meant by these terms. But they
would (most of them) use these cases correctly,
and without the least thought. The educated
Englishman or American flatters himself that
his correct speech is due to his study of grammar.
This is far from true. His speech is due
to unconscious imitation of the language of the
people with whom he comes into contact, and of
the books he reads. And needless to say, the
cultivated man comes into contact with other
cultivated men and with good literature; the ignoramus
does not.</p>

<p>Most of our thinking is influenced in this way.
The great thinkers of the past improved their
innate powers not by the study of rules for
thinking, but by reading the works of other great
thinkers, and unconsciously imitating their
habitual method and caution.</p>

<p>The fact to remember is that a rule is something
that has been formulated after the thing
which it rules. It is merely an abstract of
current practice or of good practice. Rules are
needful because they teach in little time what
would otherwise require much experience to
learn, or which we might never discover for ourselves
at all. They help us to learn things right
in the beginning; they prevent us from falling
into wrong habits. The trouble with unsupplemented
imitation, conscious or unconscious, is
that we tend to imitate another’s faults along
with his virtues. Rules enable us to distinguish,
especially if we have learned the reason for the
rules.</p>

<p>But practice and rules should not be compared
as if they were opposed. The true road is
plenty of practice with conscientious regard to
rule. It may be insisted that this has its limits;
that there is a point beyond which a man cannot
improve himself. I admit that practice has its
limits. It may be true that there is a point beyond
which a man cannot advance. But nobody
knows those limits and no one can say
when that point has come.</p>

<p>No two individuals profit in the same degree
by the same practice. With a given amount one
man will always improve faster than another.
But the slower man may keep up with his more
speedy brother by more practice. I shall not
repeat here the fable of the hare and the tortoise.
But any one who has discovered a flaw
in his mental make-up, any one who believes
that he cannot con­cen­trate, or that his memory
is poor, and that therefore he can never become
a thinker, should find consolation in the words
of William James:</p>

<p>“Depend upon it, no one need be too much
cast down by the discovery of his deficiency in
any elementary faculty of the mind. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
total mental ef­fi­ciency of a man is the resultant
of all his facul­ties. He is too complex a being
for any one of them to have the casting vote.
If any one of them do have the casting vote,
it is more likely to be the strength of his desire
and pas­sion, the strength of the interest he takes
in what is proposed. Con­cen­tra­tion, mem­o­ry,
rea­son­ing power, in­ven­tive­ness, ex­cel­lence of the
senses—all are sub­si­diary to this. No mat­ter
how scatter-brained the type of a man’s successive
fields of con­scious­ness may be, if he really
<i>care</i> for a subject, he will return to it incessantly
from his incessant wanderings, and first
and last do more with it, and get more results
from it, than another person whose attention
may be more continuous during a given interval,
but whose passion for the subject is of a more
languid and less permanent
sort.”<a class="afnanc" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/57243/57243-h/57243-h.htm#fn25" id="fnanc25">25</a></p>

BOOKS ON THINKING</span></h2>

<p class="pfirst">The reader who desires to study further
on the sub­ject of thinking will find a wide
field before him—but he will have to search in
cos­mo­pol­i­tan quarters. While much has been
written on thinking, it has been in an incidental
manner, and has found its way into books written
mainly to il­lum­i­nate other subjects. Among
the few books or essays devoted exclusively or
mainly to thinking may be mentioned:—John
Locke, <i>The Conduct of the Under­stand­ing</i>;
Isaac Watts, <i>The Improvement of the Mind</i>;
Arnold Bennett, <i>Mental Efficiency</i>; T. Sharper
Knowlson, <i>The Art of Thinking</i>; Arthur Schopenhauer,
<i>On Thinking for Oneself</i>, in his <i>Essays</i>.
The last is especially recommended. It
is only about a dozen pages long, and is the most
stimulating essay written on the subject. This,
together with John Locke’s <i>Conduct</i> (which,
by the way, is also fairly short) may be
con­si­dered the two “classics” in the meager literature
on thinking.</p>

<p>There is an extensive literature on the
psychology of reasoning, on the “positive”
science of thinking. The best single work on
this subject is John Dewey’s <i>How We Think</i>.
William James’ chapter on <i>Reasoning</i> in his
<i>Principles of Psychology</i> might also be consulted
with profit. S. S. Colvin’s, <i>The Learning
Process</i> con­tains some in­teresting chap­ters
bearing on thought.</p>

<p>On method, the amount of literature is even
more imposing than that on the psychology of
reasoning. Probably the most thorough book is
Stanley Jevon’s <i>The Principles of Science</i>,
though this, consisting of two volumes, will require
quite some ambition to attack. A good
recent short work is J. A. Thomson, <i>Introduction
to Science</i>. Herbert Spencer’s short essay,
<i>An Element in Method</i>, in his <i>Various Fragments</i>
might also be mentioned. Of those works
treating method mainly from a corrective standpoint,
I have already mentioned Jevon’s <i>Elementary
Lessons in Logic</i>. <i>The</i> authoritative
and most comprehensive book on logic is still
John Stuart Mill’s great tome. Of course this
list of books on method, as well as that on the
psychology of reasoning, cannot pretend to be
more than merely suggestive. If the reader desires
an extensive bibliography in either of these
subjects he will probably find it in one of the
books mentioned.</p>

<p>On doubt and belief, William Clifford, <i>The
Ethics of Belief</i>, and William James, <i>The Will
to Believe</i>, might be read. The viewpoints of
the two essays are in almost direct contradiction.</p>

<p>On reading, Alexander Bain’s <i>The Art of
Study</i>, in his <i>Practical Essays</i>, will be found
useful. Bacon’s essay <i>On Studies</i>, which is not
more than a couple pages long, contains more
con­cen­trated wisdom on the subject than is to
be found anywhere.</p>

<p>On subjects most worth thinking about, the
reader cannot do better than read Herbert Spencer’s
essay <i>What Knowledge is of Most Worth?</i>
in his <i>Education</i>. As to books most worth reading,
consult the lists of John Morley, Sir
John Lubbock, and Frederic Harrison; Sonnenschein’s
<i>Best Books</i> (in two volumes);
Baldwin’s <i>The Book Lover</i>; Dr. Eliot’s <i>Five Foot
Shelf</i> and Frank Parson’s <i>The World’s Best
Books</i>, previously referred to.</p>

<p>On the art of living—the art of planning time
so as to have room for thinking, as well as valuable
hints as to how that thinking is to be carried
out—consult Arnold Bennett, <i>How to Live
on Twenty-four Hours a Day</i>, and E. H. Griggs,
<i>The Use of the Margin</i> (both very, very small
books).</p>

<p>Finally, there is much useful material, as well
as incalculable inspiration, to be obtained from
the in­tel­lec­tual and literary biographies of great
thinkers. Especially is this true of auto­bio­graphy.
Among others may be mentioned the
auto­bio­graph­ies of John Stuart Mill and Herbert
Spencer, and an auto­bio­graph­i­cal frag­ment
by Charles Darwin.</p>

This may seem unjustified. Witness, however, this
remarkable statement in a prospectus of Charles Eliot’s “Five Foot
Shelf”: “&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The man who has not read the ‘Wealth of Nations’
is hardly qualified to speak or even think wisely on these vital
subjects.” If this be true, Adam Smith himself was hardly qualified
because he certainly could not have read his own book before he had
written it!</p>

The most advanced and severe psychologists may object
to some statements in this exposition. I admit that a word
may be used as the concept, <i>but only provided it is accompanied
by a “fringe” of potential associates</i>. I also admit
that in order to be dealt with as if general, the visual image
must be accompanied by such a “fringe.” But I do insist
that this fringe itself is in a constant state of flux. That is
the important point for our present purposes.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
