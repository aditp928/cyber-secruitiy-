# Overview & Notes

This archive contains the home directories for all of the accounts created through the instructor demos, activities, etc. This is all contained in the VM, as well, but this lets you explore those files without having to launch the whole VM.

Extract with: `tar -xzvf account_home_directories.tar.gz`

## SSH Service

Also—the VM has been configured to launch SSH on boot. It should be good to go as soon as you run it. *But*, just in case the service is down for some reason, run: `/etc/init.d/ssh start`.

## Account Passwords

Passwords for the accounts in this VM are:

  - ahmed: `password`
  - peleke: `dummyPassword`
  - guest: `guestPassword`
  - myPartnersAccount: `partnersPassword`
