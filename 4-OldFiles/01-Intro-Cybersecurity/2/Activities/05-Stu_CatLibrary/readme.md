### Dipping and Diving 

* **File**

  * `05-Stu_Dipping-Diving/Docs.zip`

* **Instructions**

  * Unzip the `Docs.zip` folder. Then explore the files contained within. Notice that there are four folders (`1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`). Each folder contains a text file within.
  * Your task is to use move all these files into a new folder called `All_Articles`. 
  * Then use the `cat` command to combine all of them into a single file called `full.txt`.  
  * Once combined, use the `head` and `tail` command to confirm that the files are in the right order (e.g. check that the file called `1_call_to_worship.txt` is listed first and the file `4_phone_hacking.txt` is last.)

* **Hints**
  
  * There's a fast way to concatenate multiple files of the same file extension. You may want to Google this :)
