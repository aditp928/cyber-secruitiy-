### Terminal Mazes 

* **File**

    * `03-Stu_Terminal-Mazes/Unsolved/Docs.zip`

  * **Instructions**

    * Unzip the `Docs.zip` folder. (If you have trouble unzipping, be sure to ask one of the TAs for help).
    * Navigate into the Docs folder using your Terminal. Once inside, create a folder called `all_flags` at the base directory.
    * Next use the terminal and/or GUI to explore the folder for files named `flag.txt`. 
    * Then use the `cp` command to move these files into the `all_flags` folder. Try to copy the file over in  single command if you can.

  * **Hints**

    * There are 3 flags in total. 
    * Yes. There is an easy way to do this. We'll show it to you soon! But for now, trudge along and use this exercise as practice working with file trees.
    * Resist the urge to cheat! No Copy-Pasting! :)
