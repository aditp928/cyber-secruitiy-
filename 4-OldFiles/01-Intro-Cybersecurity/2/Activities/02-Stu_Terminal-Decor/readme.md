### Terminal Decor 

  * **Instructions**

    * Using only Terminal or Git Bash, complete the following tasks:

      * Create a folder on the desktop called `My_House`.
      * Inside the `My_House` folder, create three sub-folders: `Bedroom`, `Living_Room`, `Kitchen`.
      * Inside the `Living_Room` folder, create two files called `tv.txt` and `sofa.txt`.
      * Inside the `Kitchen` folder, create two files called: `oven.txt` and `sink.txt`
      * Inside the `Bedroom` folder, create a file called: `bed.txt` and a folder called `Bathroom`. 
      * Copy the `sink.txt` file from the `Kitchen` folder into the `Bathroom` folder. 
      * Move the `tv.txt` file from the `Living_Room` and into the `Bedroom`.

    * When all is complete, your file tree should look like the below:
  
      ```
        My_House
          - Bedroom
            - bed.txt
            - tv.txt
            - Bathroom
              - sink.txt
          - Living_Room
            - softa.txt
          - Kitchen
            - sink.txt
            - oven.txt
      ```

    * Hint: Commands you will be using include: `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `cp`, and `mv`. 
    * Hint: We know it's painful. But believe us -- it's important to get good at this!
