  * **Instructions**

    * *Part 1: Combining Flags*

      * Using a combination of commands taught thus far, complete the following tasks:

        * Create a new folder called `all_flags` at the base of the `Docs` folder.
        * Find and copy all of the flag files into this folder in a single command.
        * Combine all of these flag files into a single file called flags.txt.
        * Preview the flags.txt file in the command line to confirm that all flag contents have been included.

    * *Part 2: Books and PDFs*

      * Using a combination of commands taught thus far, complete the following tasks:

        * Create a new folder called `PDFs` at the base of the `Docs` folder.
        * Find and copy all files with a pdf extension and/or the word "book" in their title into the `PDFs` folder.
        * Hint: You should end up with six files in your PDF folder.
        * Bonus: Find a way to rename all of the book files to have a pdf file extension using the command line. (Hint: You will need to research this.)
  
  * **Hints**

    * Remember the commands we've covered thus far (`cd`, `mkdir`, `cat`, `less`, `find`, and `exec`).
