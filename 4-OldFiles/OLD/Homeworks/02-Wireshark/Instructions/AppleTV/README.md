## Unit 2 | Your Apple TV!!!!!

## Background

Your little sister has come to town! After giving her the grand tour of your home, you leave to go to work. 

While you're on the job, you get a call from Apple asking you about some purchases made on your Apple TV. Apple can't discuss the details about your purchases for security reasons, but you're sure your little sister wouldn't make purchases as a practical joke.

...Right? 

Luckily, you have Wireshark capturing all the data going in and out of your home network. As soon as you get back to work, you decide to dig into what mischief your little sister has gotten into.
