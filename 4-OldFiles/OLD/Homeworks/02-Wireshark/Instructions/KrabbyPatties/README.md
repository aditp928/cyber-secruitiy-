## Unit 2 | Secret Crabby Patty Formula!!!!!

## Background

You are working at the Krusty Krab when Mr. Krabs comes up to you worried that the new employee, Squidward—who is just terrible—may have leaked the secret Crabby Patty formula.

Mr. Krabs tells you he saw a "suspicious" person chatting on AOL messenger in the restaurant the other day, so he captured everyone's traffic using wireshark. 

Mr. Krabs has set everyones laptops with a static IP address, and told you that Squidwards's static IP is `192.168.1.158`. 

As this could devastate business for the Krusty Krab, your duty is to identify everyone involved and retrieve any files they've shared with each other.

## Requirements

1. What is the name of Squidwards’s IM buddy?
1. What was the first comment in the captured IM conversation?
1. What is the name of the file Squidward transferred?
