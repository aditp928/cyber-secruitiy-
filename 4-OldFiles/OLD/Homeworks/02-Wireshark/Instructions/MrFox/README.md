## Unit 2 | The Curious Mr. Fox

## Background

Your new job is weird. 

You have to fly in by helicopter to the top of a volcano, into a skull shaped building. Your new boss works on high tech equipment, and so it's a fun and exciting place to be. 

One day, your boss informs you that a one Mr. Fox, a detective, is looking for his kidnapped daughter. He is currently being held upstairs until the "proper" authorities arrive. (*I mean how could anyone's daughter get lost on the top of a volcano?*, he asks). 

With his classic laugh, he hands you this pcap file and asks you to take a look over what Mr. Fox has been up to.
