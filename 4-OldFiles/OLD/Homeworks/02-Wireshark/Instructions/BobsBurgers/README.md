## Unit 2 | LINDA!!!!!

## Background

Congrats! You just purchased the restaurant **Bob's Burgers**!

While looking at the computers books, one of the kids pipes ups and says they saw a virus alert not too long ago.

Just think about it: A virus at a restaurant could be *devastating* for the company. Your duty is to hunt it down and find out where it could have come from.

## Requirements

- Start by exploring and profiling the capture file. Do you see anything interesting in the Protocol Hierarchy, Endpoints, IO Graph, etc.?
- Is there any evidence of unusual activity? Do you see any large downloads or suspiciously "loud" endpoints?
- Take a screenshot of any red flags.
- Research anything that stands out. Write an explanation of what it does.
