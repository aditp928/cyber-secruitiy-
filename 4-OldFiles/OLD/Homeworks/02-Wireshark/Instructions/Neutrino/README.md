## Unit 2 Assignment | "Morty...we gotta...*burp*...we gotta...get the neutrino bomb"

## Background

Congratulations! You've found yourself in an alternate universe, your name is Morty, and today, you're building networks with your super-genius grandpa, Rick.

Everything is going fine, until one day, grandpa Rick sees Kim Kardashian on the internet.

Frustrated that pop culture would take up bandwidth on the network, Rick decides to create one of his world-famous Neutrino bombs to take out any server spewing common entertainment.

But this time, he embedded the bomb in a computer virus. Your mission is to discover which computer it infected, and stop Rick from destroying all the entertainment servers in the world!

## Requirements

- Start by exploring and profiling the capture file. Do you see anything interesting in the Protocol Hierarchy, Endpoints, IO Graph, etc.?
- Is there any evidence of unusual activity? Do you see any large downloads or suspiciously "loud" endpoints?
- Take a screenshot of any red flags.
- Research anything that stands out. Write an explanation of what it does.
