# Owning the Network for Fun and Profit

Today, you're back on duty as the on-call network analyst, and you've got as challenging a day ahead as ever.

The intrusion detection system you've installed on the network has been throwing up alerts all day. Your team has already screened them for youâ€”some were false positives, but some looked like genuinely suspicious activity. They went ahead and did the of work writing up background briefs and collecting the capture data you'll need to investigate each incident.

For each incident, you'll be expected to submit a markdown or Office document with answers to the questions in the brief.

You *must* include screenshots justifying your responses to earn full credit. If, for example, you think the device with the IP address `66.249.76.41` is flooding the network with malware, *document it*. Take a screenshot of the packets that prove it, and submit them in your report.

Remember: **The Proof is in the Packet**!
