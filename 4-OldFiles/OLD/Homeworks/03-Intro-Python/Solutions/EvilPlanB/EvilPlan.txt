SOMEONE BROKE INTO MY EVIL ZIP FILE!
HOW DARE THEY! THEY SHALL NEVER GET INTO THIS ONE THOUGH!

Your objective is simple: World Domination.

Your motive is a little bit more complex: Money

Stage One: To begin your plan, you must first incapacitate a rock star. This will cause the world to sign up for life insurance policies, terrified by your arrival. Who is this Sadistic Fiend? Where did they come from? And why do they look so good in Battle Armor?

Stage Two: Next, you must sabotage Mt. Rushmore. This will all be done from a floating Fortress, a mysterious place of unrivaled dark glory. Upon seeing this, the world will wet their pants, as countless hordes of mutant race hasten to do your every bidding.

Stage Three: Finally, you must let loose your unholy weapon, bringing about Pain, suffering, the usual. Your name shall become synonymous with dear God No, and no man will ever again dare take your lunch money. Everyone will bow before your Superhuman Powers, and the world will have no choice but to pray to you for enlightenment.
