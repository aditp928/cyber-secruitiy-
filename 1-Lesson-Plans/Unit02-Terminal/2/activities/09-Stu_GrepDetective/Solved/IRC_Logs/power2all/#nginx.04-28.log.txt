2014-04-28T00:44:32  <chipotle> hi, i'm trying to install varnish with no success. when i try to restart nginx it says that something is already listening on port 80. the thing is, i only have one vhost file and it's listening on 8080
2014-04-28T00:44:35  <chipotle> what else can i check for?
2014-04-28T00:44:41  <chipotle> i just get a wsod when i go to my webpage

2014-04-28T00:52:13  <combusean> netstat -a |grep tcp might be more useful

2014-04-28T00:58:21  <combusean> you def have something going on :80 but I can't tell what it is
2014-04-28T00:58:26  <chipotle> changed my listen dir back to 80 in the vhost config
2014-04-28T00:58:56  <chipotle> nothing shows up with that command

2014-04-28T01:06:37  <combusean> what env are you running in?
2014-04-28T01:07:42  <chipotle> ubuntu 12.0.4 on aws
2014-04-28T01:08:59  <combusean> ok, on your recent pastie, you have nginx workers going on :80, is that what you want?
2014-04-28T01:09:39  <chipotle> no i want it on 8080 ad varnish on 80
2014-04-28T01:09:57  <chipotle> so should i try to configure varnish again, then run lsof | grep -i tcp ?
2014-04-28T01:10:15  <combusean> lsof |grep -i tcp just tells you what services are running and listening to what ports
2014-04-28T01:10:22  <combusean> you definitely still have nginx going on :80
2014-04-28T01:11:37  <combusean> did you service restart nginx before you changed the config files?
2014-04-28T01:11:44  <combusean> erm, after?
2014-04-28T01:12:09  <chipotle> yes

2014-04-28T01:12:44  <combusean> i haven't worked with varnish
2014-04-28T01:12:57  <combusean> i know that if you stop nginx in redhat, the workers sometimes take forever to clean up

2014-04-28T01:16:54  <combusean> lemme see your nginx.conf
2014-04-28T01:18:30  <chipotle> nginx.conf: http://pastie.org/9118810
2014-04-28T01:20:10  *** XATRIX has joined #nginx
2014-04-28T01:21:26  <combusean> chipotle, you don't have a listen 8080; in your nginx.conf file
2014-04-28T01:21:36  <chipotle> combusean: i do that in the vhost config
2014-04-28T01:23:08  <combusean> can i see that one too?
2014-04-28T01:23:27  <chipotle> seems like varnishd is running on both 80 and 8080
2014-04-28T01:23:32  <chipotle> according to netstat -anp --tcp --udp | grep LISTEN
2014-04-28T01:24:04  <chipotle> see? http://pastie.org/9118821
2014-04-28T01:24:35  *** tobi__ has joined #nginx
2014-04-28T01:24:56  <combusean> aha
2014-04-28T01:25:10  <combusean> nginx is on tcp 80 and varnish is on tcp6 80
2014-04-28T01:25:22  <combusean> that's kinda fucked up
2014-04-28T01:25:47  <chipotle> orlock: https://gist.github.com/cmejo/11363150
2014-04-28T01:26:33  <chipotle> line 9 should say 8080
2014-04-28T01:26:36  <chipotle> not 80
2014-04-28T01:26:39  <jaybe> chipotle, the unspoken default for nginx is to listen on 80.
2014-04-28T01:26:59  <jaybe> meaning... if you do not explicitly state otherwise, `listen 80` is presumed.
2014-04-28T01:27:16  <chipotle> jaybe: well, in my vhost config, i say 8080
2014-04-28T01:27:17  <jaybe> lines 3-6 fall into that category
2014-04-28T01:27:22  <chipotle> so varnish listens on 80...
2014-04-28T01:27:43  *** pilgo has joined #nginx
2014-04-28T01:27:44  <chipotle> oh, so put another listen 8080 after line 5?
2014-04-28T01:27:46  <pilgo> Hi all.
2014-04-28T01:27:52  <combusean> hi pilgo
2014-04-28T01:28:05  <pilgo> Iâ€™m trying to redirect all users from https to http
2014-04-28T01:28:10  <jaybe> if you do not specify a listen:PORT, the presumed default is and always will be listen:80
2014-04-28T01:28:11  <pilgo> (no longer need https)
2014-04-28T01:28:26  <pilgo> most google stuff talks about how to do the opposite
2014-04-28T01:28:42  <jaybe> pilgo, example:  server { listen 443; ...; return 301 http://example.com$request_uri; }
2014-04-28T01:28:49  <chipotle> jaybe: okay
2014-04-28T01:28:58  <chipotle> i did that, here's my netstat output:
2014-04-28T01:29:15  <chipotle> https://gist.github.com/cmejo/11363211
2014-04-28T01:29:43  <jaybe> what about it
2014-04-28T01:29:50  <combusean> chipotle, you don't have varnish configured to listen off of normal tcp
2014-04-28T01:29:55  <combusean> just IPV6
2014-04-28T01:30:04  <chipotle> combusean: how do i change that?
2014-04-28T01:30:12  <combusean> i don't know, i haven't used varnish
2014-04-28T01:30:16  <combusean> but that's your problem
2014-04-28T01:30:57  <combusean> varnishd is listening off :6082
2014-04-28T01:31:05  <combusean> that you can access from localhost
2014-04-28T01:31:41  <chipotle> how do i access from localhost?
2014-04-28T01:31:44  <chipotle> it's on an ec2
2014-04-28T01:31:56  <pilgo> jaybe: Doesnâ€™t seem to do it. http://dpaste.com/1801160/
2014-04-28T01:31:59  <combusean> X forwarding
2014-04-28T01:32:12  <pilgo> FF says Error code: ssl_error_rx_record_too_long
2014-04-28T01:32:20  <combusean> remote-host# apt-get install xauth
2014-04-28T01:32:33  <combusean> your-computer# ssh -CX remote-host
2014-04-28T01:32:46  <jaybe> pilgo, you must configure certificates for ssl regardless of context
2014-04-28T01:32:59  <jaybe> pilgo, it's how ssl works; handshake/ssl first.
2014-04-28T01:33:00  <pilgo> jaybe: oh dang
2014-04-28T01:33:21  <combusean> chipotle, :6082 is varnishd's management interface
2014-04-28T01:33:51  <combusean> it's really beyond this channel how varnish works

2014-04-28T09:46:40  <jaybe> *cough* use a package
2014-04-28T09:47:29  <dman777_alter> jaybe: long story...short version I can't
2014-04-28T09:47:50  <thresh> what kind of contents
2014-04-28T09:48:07  <jaybe> kitten.gif
2014-04-28T09:48:11  <thresh> official packages dont ship anything in /var/lib/nginx
2014-04-28T09:49:01  <dman777_alter> hm...I have --http-client-body-temp-path=/var/lib/nginx/body  in ./configure
2014-04-28T09:49:37  <thresh> well, mkdir is your friend then
2014-04-28T09:49:48  <thresh> and chown, probably
2014-04-28T09:49:50  <jaybe>  /var/lib is generally used for sporadic, transient data
2014-04-28T09:50:07  <jaybe> i.e. it's not likely pre-populated with anything
2014-04-28T09:51:15  <ngxbot> Paste from jaybe: [ http://p.ngx.cc/ed ] - dman_777_alter - basic /var/lib
2014-04-28T09:51:36  <dman777_alter> ya, but nginx complains nginx: [emerg] mkdir() "/var/lib/nginx/body" failed when I start
2014-04-28T09:51:39  <dman777_alter> it

2014-04-28T09:52:16  <jaybe> well, if you've configured your own nginx, and you've configured it to be in a position to use /var/lib/nginx/body caching, well, ... then its going to expect what you've promised it :)
2014-04-28T09:53:02  <dman777_alter> jaybe: ya, I just assumed it would create the directory
2014-04-28T09:53:13  <jaybe> it?
2014-04-28T09:53:44  <jaybe> package management and initialization scripts of a package create variable directories, path, and files, ... and ensure proper permissions, etc.
2014-04-28T09:54:07  <Oli> Is there a way for configtest (or other) to show what the configuration errors are? I'm just getting a simple [fail] at the moment.

2014-04-28T10:57:57  <guy> issue
2014-04-28T10:58:25  <guy> Nginx started to cutting the output of the file when you change based on the new file size, but keeping the old file content.
2014-04-28T10:58:56  <guy> e.g. if file was 'aaaaaaaaaa' and I changed the file to 'bbb', the response would be 'aaa'
2014-04-28T10:59:29  <jaybe> no idea wtf you're talking about

2014-04-28T16:52:16  <fossxplorer> Hmm, this is not my issue. Perhaps i wasn't clear, but when the backend app communicates with the outside world, i want it to use the proxy's IP, i.e the web site's IP

2014-04-28T19:24:59  <Coburn> Just a quick question - on the wiki, one security measure for PHP is "not to allow PHP scripts to be run inside image folders". Some script kiddies exploit gallery script upload scripts and put their shells in there, then access it. Is it possible for nginx to be the watchdog and say "Hey, that script is inside a image folder, 404 time"
2014-04-28T19:25:16  *** johnkevinmbasco has joined #nginx
2014-04-28T19:25:37  <Coburn> In other words, if the path contains ".php" and also contains "images", then either 404 or 403 you shall not pass?
2014-04-28T19:26:11  <Coburn> because then if a kiddie goes to somesite/images/mykewlshell.php, nginx says 403
2014-04-28T19:26:24  *** monokrome has joined #nginx
2014-04-28T19:26:55  <Coburn> although, it would need to be also recursive, because I remember a joomla website get compromised and the scripts were in images/stories/ex.php

2014-04-28T19:28:02  <jaybe> Coburn, you can do it however you want. basing it on the term "image" being in the URI is pretty vague and weak however

2014-04-28T19:29:38  <Coburn> Well, this is shared hosting
2014-04-28T19:30:21  <jaybe> Coburn, it totally depends on you, your 'app', the way you do things, etc. ideally - you put PHP crap in /jailed/php or the likes. and/or you limit php to just the 'app' (/wordpress), etc.
2014-04-28T19:30:26  <mdeboard> Coburn: Your app shouldn't allow uploading of .php files
2014-04-28T19:30:35  <mdeboard> I'm probably misunderstanding, I'll go away

2014-04-28T19:31:46  <Coburn> the app shouldn't allow uploading of PHP files, but well... it was exploited
2014-04-28T19:32:04  <Coburn> joomla actually was being exploited through the file manager, and then image manager

2014-04-28T20:00:55  <chipotle> hm, so what do i need to do change it?

2014-04-28T20:03:32  <mdeboard> Knowing nothing about fastcgi and only googling like 2 minutes, it looks like you would need to define a "key_zone"
2014-04-28T20:03:43  <mdeboard> and th ename of that "key_zone" would be the value of fastcgi_cache

Many, unfortunately, spam you with ads, javascripts, and filthiness. p.ngx.cc provides- 1) nginx-specific configuration highlighting and linking, 2) No javascript, 3) Interacts with #nginx, 4) No ads. Helpers *trust* visiting p.ngx.cc, and are therefore more likely to try to help you.

2014-04-28T22:32:11  *** toxboi has quit IRC
2014-04-28T22:32:16  <thewiz_> so basically my app is running at 108.80.8.58:3000
2014-04-28T22:32:37  <thewiz_> and im trying to make it run just on 108.80.8.58
2014-04-28T22:32:56  <thewiz_> so that i can use a dns/masking service and just have serpnet.ml point to the ip
2014-04-28T22:33:07  <thewiz_> right now its pointing to the ip
2014-04-28T22:33:15  <jaybe> thewiz_, is the same machine serving port 80 with nginx?
2014-04-28T22:33:22  <thewiz_> yeah
2014-04-28T22:33:47  <jaybe> that machine is not accessible on port 80
2014-04-28T22:33:58  <jaybe> as i said, a network/firewall issue
2014-04-28T22:34:00  <thewiz_> probably because im trying to do this http://p.ngx.cc/e31c7eeb627c6975
2014-04-28T22:34:31  <thewiz_> the machine is fully open, its an nginx issue
2014-04-28T22:34:52  <jaybe> 1) the IP, 108.80.8.58 is not listening on port 80. and the port is not allowed.  2)  www.serpnet.ml resolves to a different IP address all-together.
2014-04-28T22:35:09  <jaybe> it's not open; and if you tested it yourself from a remote location, you'd know it too
2014-04-28T22:35:45  *** vlad_starkov has quit IRC
2014-04-28T22:35:52  <thewiz_> its opened in the router settings
2014-04-28T22:35:59  <thewiz_> so nginx is blocking it somehow
2014-04-28T22:36:06  <jaybe> so my bank account says i have 19 million in savings
2014-04-28T22:36:24  <thewiz_> like if i were to install apache2 right now it would work through port 80
2014-04-28T22:36:25  <jaybe> doesn't mean it's true. go try and withdraw.  or try to connect to the port remotely.
2014-04-28T22:36:44  <jaybe> and again, the host name your describe doesn't even point to that IP
2014-04-28T22:37:33  <thewiz_> nope
2014-04-28T22:37:38  <thewiz_> http://108.80.8.58 as in my domain settings
