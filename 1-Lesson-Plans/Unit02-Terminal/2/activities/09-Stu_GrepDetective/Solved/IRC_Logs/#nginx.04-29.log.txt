2014-04-29T04:46:56  <haxie> hello, I'm trying to setup an image server on my nginx/openresty server
2014-04-29T04:47:05  <haxie> I've been using this code: http://leafo.net/posts/creating_an_image_server.html but cannot get it working
2014-04-29T04:47:19  <haxie> here is the relevant portion of my nginx.conf: http://p.ngx.cc/68eb2401c8fa7a0c
2014-04-29T04:47:32  <haxie> here is the lua file processing images: http://p.ngx.cc/5e915585f9c92a83
2014-04-29T04:47:41  <haxie> and here is the error: http://p.ngx.cc/3ab975354fe04797
2014-04-29T04:48:08  <haxie> I suspect it's some issue with my paths, but can't figure out why...

2014-04-29T07:07:36  <kolbyjack> You need a $uri/ in there to match directories

2014-04-29T07:10:18  <kolbyjack> So a request for /dir/ wasn't succeeding, and it would fall back to /index.php, and it appears that your php configuration isn't working, so you got primary script unknown

2014-04-29T07:12:42  <kolbyjack> It doesn't matter if the expanded value of $uri ends with a /, it's the literal argument value that's used to determine whether the test is for a file or a directory.

2014-04-29T07:55:42  <hefest> [MT]: there is nothing that indicates setting of "no-cache" in nginx config. i have location /static/ { expires modified 1d; ... } , thats all.

2014-04-29T07:56:20  <tuxtoti> can i use nginx as a load balancer for a set of SOCKS proxies ?

2014-04-29T08:35:22  <yochai> hello! I have a question about running a dokuwiki instance as a vhost on nginx - but not as the root-level (so.. https://www.example.com/dokuwiki).
2014-04-29T08:35:23  <yochai> I used to run it as http, but I've encryped my TLD, and want to run it under nginx instead of apache
2014-04-29T08:35:23  <yochai> I can login and see my default page, but when i go to links it generates an incorrect url - it should be https://example.com/dokuwiki/PAGE_name but instead it is https://example.com/dokuwiki/doku.php/PAGE_NAME - which of course returns an error!
2014-04-29T08:35:23  <yochai> I've put the appropriate basedir in local.php... but other than that I'm out of luck - all of the online guides on this assume you'll be running dokuwiki on the toplevel, not as a folder... I *think* i have my rewrite rules correct

2014-04-29T09:38:23  <broheimium> jaybe, I set up several wordpress sites on a server (didn't make them), and they use php-fpm and fastcgi and that sort of stuff. I was wondering whether enabling gzip was enough to speed up the serving of the websites, or should I go for some advanced caching (if there's such a thing), or I don't know, just wanted to get some pointers
2014-04-29T09:38:28  <broheimium> I'm free to optimize anything

2014-04-29T09:40:03  <jaybe> broheimium, well, php sucks and is a huge resource hog; there's that. but there are things you can do. for instance, use `expires` on static files for client-side caching. there is also nginx `fastcgi_cache` which caches the output of PHP. need to read up on, "nginx optimization" and "nginx wordpress optimiz"

2014-04-29T09:42:11  <jaybe> broheimium, but you'll need to read up and understand that by caching, you are serving snapshots of the normally-dynamic wordpress. that means - it's a snaphot/image in time of what wordpress normally dynamically produces. so - you'll need to comprehend how/when to *not* be static... like when you *want* real-time php/wordpress (login, wp-admin, etc.)

2014-04-29T09:55:28  <steadystatic> I have a quick question re: nginx and wordpress. When I go to site.com/wp-admin it redirects me to site.com/wordpress/wp-admin…..but if enter in the same exact URL again…it works and goes to site.com/wp-admin like I’d expect. http://p.ngx.cc/0790b617540edb2b
2014-04-29T09:56:03  <steadystatic> pasted my conf I don’t think I put in any redirect rule guessing it’s something wordpress is doing I’m just figuring out how to outsmart it with nginx directives
2014-04-29T09:56:08  <jaybe> steadystatic, clear browser cache and reset browser. and ensure you've properly configured wordpress to work installed in a subdirectory.

2014-04-29T10:07:27  <programmerq> zeljko__: the way I've don that in the past is I have a location block ahead of the maintenace logic

2014-04-29T10:08:05  <programmerq> so you'd have a location for /test.html at the top

2014-04-29T10:10:46  <jaybe> nginx.org/r/location
2014-04-29T10:11:53  <jaybe> lorenx, ensure you are using a `location` for matching ~ \.php within the subdir location to ensure the root is properly passing. also ensure you've defined an `index` file for index.php.  and within the php matching block, use something such as:   `try_files $uri =404;`
2014-04-29T10:12:45  <lorenx> jaybe: ok but wait, the *global* try_files should be valid for subdirs too, am i missing something?
2014-04-29T10:13:21  <jaybe> lorenx, a global, higher-in-hierarchy try_files will be 'valid', however, it will retain the $document_root of the hierarchy

2014-04-29T10:24:37  <qwebirc33516> are you suggesting i read the article the bot linked?
2014-04-29T10:25:03  <lorenx> jaybe: so there is no way to avoid the custom try_files subpath inside each sublocation? it would be nice i can add a working subdir without editing my nginx configurations files though
2014-04-29T10:25:28  <jaybe> crystal77, you could regex match all *.pdf files and not enable the header; just keep in mind any other directives in the / location will not apply to the newly matched location unless you also add them there:  e.g.  location ~ \.pdf { }
2014-04-29T10:25:59  <crystal77> jaybe: The weird thing is, the file-type isn't a pdf. You click a link, and it starts the download of the pdf, but you never see the URL. It's odd.
2014-04-29T10:26:12  <jaybe> lorenx, serving 'apps' out of subdirs has implications; this is one of them

2014-04-29T10:30:23  <jaybe> lorenx, `index` can go in the top of the server { } block to apply to all unless otherwise specified; that is common.  understand that setting `index` allows the $uri/ in `try_files $uri/` to actually try, e.g.  http://example.com/subdir -->  /subdir/index.php

2014-04-29T12:54:06  <MXBrandon> I have 1 framework that is running multiple domains.  All my web accessible files are in /srv/www/public_html/domain.com.  Only things in each domain.com folder are web accessible.  I want each site though to load the same default php script at /srv/www/public_html/start.php              That is a non-web accessible file, but I want all traffic to start there to get routed correctly.  I know I can do a symlink to it, but

2014-04-29T13:05:57  <MXBrandon> Well, I am new to nginx yet.  I am basically porting over our site which currently runs on Apache to a dev server running nginx
2014-04-29T13:06:26  *** xtilt has quit IRC
2014-04-29T13:06:48  <MXBrandon> In Apache, that seems to be the best way to go about it, at least from all the frameworks I have used over the years. If there is a better way to do it in nginx, then I will read more on how to do that. But the first step is to just get the site running on a dev server first
2014-04-29T13:07:01  <stqism> A good way to do that with nginx is to maintain a folder that the nginx.conf does a wildcard include to, adding each site and its domain name in a conf
2014-04-29T13:07:14  <jaybe> MXBrandon, location = /account/login { alias /srv/www/outside/start.php; }

2014-04-29T13:07:51  <stqism> MXBrandon: Sounds like what you want to do is use php in place of server blocks and server_name
2014-04-29T13:08:04  *** maxorator has quit IRC
2014-04-29T13:08:33  <MXBrandon> We have thousands of directories, so typing them all in an nginx config would be impossible.  Many of them are dynamic
2014-04-29T13:08:50  <stqism> Well, in the nginx.conf you can use embedded perl
2014-04-29T13:08:53  <MXBrandon> The start.php script is essentially just quering a database with all the slugs and going from there

2014-04-29T13:09:26  <stqism> If you have some sort of system it reads, you can use this perl to access this and pass the correct root
2014-04-29T13:09:29  <jaybe> you can be dynamic with regular expressions, perl, lua, etc. ... upon popular directives such as `server_name`, `root`, `location`, etc.
2014-04-29T13:09:59  *** crystal77 has quit IRC
2014-04-29T13:10:20  <stqism> MXBrandon: Basically use a scripting language to query the database and pass the correct values to root/location
2014-04-29T13:10:46  <stqism> You'd just deal with every server_name in a single server block

2014-04-29T13:28:23  <MXBrandon> jaybe: Outside of the cleanliness, is there a performance advantage to using one config like you mentioned versus having multiple site configs?
2014-04-29T13:28:40  <MXBrandon> reason I ask is that the server has about 10 sites.  Only 3 are sharing the same framework though
2014-04-29T13:28:55  *** zach23 has joined #nginx
2014-04-29T13:28:56  <MXBrandon> so doing a global config like that would break all the other sites
2014-04-29T13:29:03  <jaybe> MXBrandon, you're more than welcome to break out servers/domains; if the configurations are not the same, that would be sensible
2014-04-29T13:29:16  <MXBrandon> ok, thats how I have it setup now
2014-04-29T13:29:20  <zach23> Does anyone know of any decent contract administrator for Apache/Nginx for optimizing things for a better server load for us…?
2014-04-29T13:29:25  <jaybe> MXBrandon, it's much cleaner and clearer to use separate domains/configs

2014-04-29T16:51:42  <wabash> So I'm starting nginx with the option -c so I can specify my configfile. But the problem is that it's looking for other files it needs in the same place. Default is /etc/nginx.  How do I get it to use nginx.conf in my home dir, but all the other files in /etc/nginx?
2014-04-29T16:51:48  *** yani has quit IRC
2014-04-29T16:51:57  <daemon> is there any language I can use interally in nginx
2014-04-29T16:52:09  <daemon> I thought you could bind with perl.so
2014-04-29T16:52:14  <daemon> but apparently not
2014-04-29T16:53:19  <[MT]> wabash: that depends on your OS and what ports that user is allowed to bind to, typically not 1024 or below

2014-04-29T18:06:33  <GRMrGecko> Will Nginx take the initiative  to enable OCSD Stapling by default?
2014-04-29T18:07:18  <lewellyn> probably not. assuming you really meant ocsp.
2014-04-29T18:07:39  <lewellyn> too many CAs, esepecially for internal use, don't do OCSP and the overhead in any case may be unacceptable.

2014-04-29T18:09:24  <GRMrGecko> lewellyn: I didn't think there is a huge overhead due to caching
2014-04-29T18:09:37  <GRMrGecko> the server should cache for several hours
2014-04-29T18:09:53  <GRMrGecko> Microsoft has it enabled by default on their IIS servers
2014-04-29T18:09:54  <lewellyn> i don't believe it caches "the server was unreachable"
2014-04-29T18:09:57  <GRMrGecko> why shouldn't Nginx?
2014-04-29T18:10:12  <GRMrGecko> true
2014-04-29T18:10:13  <lewellyn> iis enables many things by default which nginx does not.
2014-04-29T18:10:38  <lewellyn> doesn't iis still enable indexes by default?
2014-04-29T18:10:49  <GRMrGecko> Not sure
2014-04-29T18:10:55  <GRMrGecko> I don't trust Microsoft one bit
2014-04-29T18:11:20  <lewellyn> if they diverge even at that level, expecting parity with something as polarizing as stapling is absurd :)
2014-04-29T18:11:23  <GRMrGecko> but yeah... I think ether OCSP should be widely known or enabled by default.

2014-04-29T18:12:28  <GRMrGecko> lewellyn: I understand where you're coming from.
2014-04-29T18:12:39  <lewellyn> however: For the OCSP stapling to work, the certificate of the server certificate issuer should be known. If the ssl_certificate file does not contain intermediate certificates, the certificate of the server certificate issuer should be present in the ssl_trusted_certificate file.
2014-04-29T18:12:42  <apes> Can the 1.6.0 line be used on Ubuntu 10.04?
2014-04-29T18:13:03  <GRMrGecko> maybe Nginx can check the cert for OCSP server and if it doesn't exist, do not even attempt?
2014-04-29T18:13:10  <lewellyn> apes: http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/ubuntu/ sure seems to have packages.
2014-04-29T18:13:27  <lewellyn> http://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html#mainline

2014-04-29T18:36:06  <wabash> hey, another question for you all..... I'm looking at a system now, that has an nginx frontend, and another java-based backend. What's the typical split in functionality? is nginx just handling incoming network requests and forwarding them to the back end? Or is there something more complex going on typically?

2014-04-29T18:38:42  *** Vovko has joined #nginx
2014-04-29T18:39:17  <houk> wabash: that's usually the way to do it.
2014-04-29T18:39:44  <houk> wabash: you can serve static assets straight from nginx if your app has a lot of them but generally just proxy everything through
2014-04-29T18:40:20  <wabash> houk: Thanks for responding. Can you tell me a bit more ------ in this case, what does nginx do besides forwarding? url mapping, correct?
2014-04-29T18:41:48  *** johnkevinmbasco has quit IRC
2014-04-29T18:42:07  <houk> wabash: that all depends on what you want it to do.  kind of a vague answer but it's a vague question :)
2014-04-29T18:42:17  <wabash> indeed!
2014-04-29T18:42:22  <wabash> vague is good!
2014-04-29T18:42:29  <wabash> I'm just trying to get a sense about it.
2014-04-29T18:42:56  <houk> wabash: lowest hanging fruit would be just to proxy requests from the frontend proxy server (nginx) to your backend application.  It's a nice way of not directly exposing that machine to the Internet (if it's not on the same box)
2014-04-29T18:43:07  <houk> also with nginx you can do some nice things like waf if you like
2014-04-29T18:43:12  <houk> but that's a little advance
2014-04-29T18:43:42  <wabash> wafL?
