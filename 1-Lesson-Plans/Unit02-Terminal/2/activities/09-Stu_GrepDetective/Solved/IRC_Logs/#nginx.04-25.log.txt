2014-04-25T00:59:58  <vandemar> swordfischer: do you have a ssl terminator or reverse proxy in front of nginx?
2014-04-25T01:00:12  <Peng> swordfischer: It might not work putting it inside a 'server' block. Try putting it in 'http'.
2014-04-25T01:02:23  <swordfischer> vandemar: that nginx instance is the only webserver I run, so no, no terminators
2014-04-25T01:02:46  <swordfischer> Peng: if I do not include it, but add it in let's say, in ssl.conf it works
2014-04-25T01:03:00  <Peng> since the SSL version is negotiated far before it decides which vhost to use...
2014-04-25T01:03:54  <vandemar> but wouldn't it use the ssl settings from the default ssl vhost which is presumably that one?
2014-04-25T01:04:27  <Peng> I would think so, but perhaps not.
2014-04-25T01:04:45  <swordfischer> so, it's not possible to load different protocols/ciphers based on host?
2014-04-25T01:04:52  <Peng> I don't know.
2014-04-25T01:05:03  <swordfischer> hmm, I'll just test something
2014-04-25T01:05:08  <Peng> I know ssl_dhparam works inside 'server' blocks.
2014-04-25T01:05:18  <Peng> But I've always made it the same for every vhost on an iP:port too.
2014-04-25T01:05:48  <Peng> There's also the question of what the SSL protocol theoretically allows and what Nginx supports.
2014-04-25T01:06:04  <swordfischer> Oh, well
2014-04-25T01:06:17  <swordfischer> I just put ssl_protocols inside the first ssl server loaded
2014-04-25T01:06:21  <swordfischer> now it works
2014-04-25T01:06:25  <swordfischer> so I guess you are right
2014-04-25T01:06:42  <Peng> wait, you have multiple server blocks with ssl?
2014-04-25T01:06:45  <vandemar> uh, there's another ssl server block?
2014-04-25T01:07:19  <swordfischer> yeah, about 7

2014-04-25T01:09:38  <swordfischer> I'm guessing on your ellipsis that it's somehow wrong, Peng ?

2014-04-25T01:10:17  <Peng> It's not wrong.
2014-04-25T01:10:42  <Peng> Most ssl settings like ssl_protocol are IP:port-specific, not vhost-specific, though.
2014-04-25T01:11:02  <Peng> I don't know what happens if you include them in only one vhost of several listening on the same IP:port.
2014-04-25T01:11:05  <Peng> Well, now I do, I guess.
2014-04-25T01:11:11  <Peng> "It doesn't work" being what happens :P
2014-04-25T01:11:25  <swordfischer> Ah, so I should just use another IP for "weak" configurations?
2014-04-25T01:11:34  <vandemar> you shouldn't have weak configurations
2014-04-25T01:11:45  *** john2x_ has quit IRC
2014-04-25T01:12:00  <vandemar> I don't know why you have multiple levels of includes for a handful of ssl settings
2014-04-25T01:12:13  <vandemar> The ssl settings should be included in http context so they apply to all vhosts
2014-04-25T01:12:24  <Peng> I use different "strong" and "stronger" SSL configurations sometimes :)
2014-04-25T01:12:25  <vandemar> and it helps to pastebin your entire config so that these sorts of problems are obvious
2014-04-25T01:12:26  <Peng> I don't have a "weak" one though.
2014-04-25T01:12:59  <swordfischer> I just run a site with a lot of IE users, and with my "strong" cipher suites they fail to connect, which was why I started doing this
2014-04-25T01:13:18  <swordfischer> I just thought it would be "smarter" to only include one file per vhost instead for including 3

2014-04-25T01:16:01  <Peng> More specifically, IE *6* users?
2014-04-25T01:16:10  <Peng> Even IE 6 has a checkbox to enable TLS 1.0.
2014-04-25T01:16:24  <vandemar> IF any IE can't connect it's because you're severely restricting available ciphersuites.
2014-04-25T01:16:51  <lewellyn> if ie 6 can't connect, it doesn't matter anymore imo ;)

2014-04-25T01:18:13  <vandemar> if you really want DH you have to tweak the first one to support it, but clients that don't support ECDHE are IMO not worth caring about PFS for.
2014-04-25T01:18:19  <Peng> vandemar: swordfischer *is* severely restricting available cipher suites, but since its closest thing to a decent cipher suite is TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA, it's not surprising if someone doesn't support it.
2014-04-25T01:18:28  <vandemar> lewellyn: is it better than mine, above? :)

2014-04-25T01:32:47  <lewellyn> stqism: the point of keeping openssl on windows is to have a common ssl/tls implementation on all platforms, to ensure that bugs aren't caused by "that different platform".
2014-04-25T01:33:09  <murnieza> I cannot se ssi in list of nginx configure argumens. Isn't it compiled by default?
2014-04-25T01:33:11  <vandemar> some cross-platform software for windows uses openssl instead of schannel.  openvpn, for instance.  probably crypto filesharing apps too
2014-04-25T01:33:16  <lewellyn> it's actively sought as a feature by many cross-platform devs. i am 99% sure that nginx on windows uses openssl, for instance.
2014-04-25T01:33:27  <TheJHNZ> does 1.6 use sites-enabled ?

2014-04-25T03:10:02  <jaybe> cson, look at it more so as using `location` to pick out what needs to be served statically, and then using `location` to catch whatever else in masse to proxy_pass

2014-04-25T03:12:44  <jaybe> cson, URI /static is what would be referenced by apps, html, code, etc., ... which the client then requests back to the server... which is caught by... /static
2014-04-25T03:12:45  <cson> jaybe: ok that might not be that painful since these apps fortunately have few subdirs
2014-04-25T03:13:34  <jaybe> cson, plan/understand where/how static content will reside and be served from in terms of URI. have a good grasp on the 'what and how'... then implement it with nginx.

2014-04-25T05:00:50  <FredFlintStoner> anyone ?
2014-04-25T05:05:14  <`VL> FredFlintStoner: what do you mean by 'pass in the http://server before the GET request' ? the words about 'get out onto the web' makes me feel that you are trying to use nginx as a forward proxy, which it is not
2014-04-25T05:07:43  *** voxadam has joined #nginx
2014-04-25T05:10:56  <voxadam> I have a VM with a few programms serving "sites" for local consumption. One of the programs is on the typical port 80, the two others are on non-standard ports. If I'm looking to get all the "sites" on port 80 (from the point of the remote browser) but in different base URIs should I be looking at rewrite rules? As you can tell I'm not a web guy. I'm much more comfortable with embedded systems
2014-04-25T05:10:56  <voxadam> and wire protocols.

2014-04-25T05:16:39  <FredFlintStoner> `VL: yes, i think im trying to use it as a forward proxy to a specific machine on the web. I want to cache my rpm files, and if they are not on the box already, the get them off the net

2014-04-25T05:17:53  <FredFlintStoner> ive got the setup working if nginx has direct access to the web, however in another env. outgoing access has to happen via cntl. and this is where it breaks

2014-04-25T05:19:13  <FredFlintStoner> i almost almost got it working with proxy_method, where I hardcode the GET and the dest machine details.
2014-04-25T05:19:37  <`VL> FredFlintStoner: nginx is not a forward proxy. some parts may seem to work, but it is not supported. use squid or whatever for forward proxy.

2014-04-25T12:03:52  <kolbyjack> and you're sure you're getting 404s, and not 403s?
2014-04-25T12:03:54  <kolbyjack> !403
2014-04-25T12:03:54  <ngxbot> Every parent dir needs +x perms for the user (nginx user, or php-fpm user if a php failure, etc).  Check with: `namei -om /path/to/file`. If symlinks are involved, make sure they point to a valid path. Make sure chroots have access to the right paths. Make sure SELinux (e.g. Fedora) or Apparmor (e.g. Ubuntu) or other MAC security systems are not interfering. Unix perms: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_(Unix)
2014-04-25T12:04:22  <kolbyjack> /home directories generally have strict permissions, and that may be an issue.

2014-04-25T14:37:57  <kolbyjack> Says you can't do what?
2014-04-25T14:38:05  *** SleePy has joined #nginx
2014-04-25T14:38:15  <kolbyjack> and the wiki is hopelessly out of date, it was mostly abandoned when the official docs appeared :(
2014-04-25T14:39:11  <jdoe> use variables in proxy_pass like that. So does a large chunk of google, but again, apparently out of date. :)
2014-04-25T14:39:53  <jdoe> I need to figure out a different shortcut, I guess... I need to pass things to an army of jboss backends, with borderline random ports... and I don't want to have to define everything twice if I can avoid it :/
2014-04-25T14:40:48  <kolbyjack> I wouldn't be surprised if a large chunk of google is still reporting things that haven't been true since 0.6.32, since that was the latest version available for debian/ubuntu for a long time.
2014-04-25T14:41:11  <kolbyjack> and even newer crap written is still mostly crap :(

2014-04-25T14:49:37  <jdoe> kolbyjack: yeah... for example, for any given service, there might be a handful of upstreams... their ports will be internally consistent (ie all http ports the same, all https ports the same), but they won't be 80/443... maybe 10010/10011 or something. I want to avoid having to define the location blocks and proxy pass directives etc. twice, but I'm not sure how or if I can do that.

2014-04-25T17:46:31  <Alayde> Hey everyone, I've a quick (hopefully concise) question. Is there a way to limit the requests that are retried, to servers in an upstream block, based on their method? For instance, only have nginx retry the next upstream server on a 500 -if- the method is a GET or a DELETE and not retry if the method is a POST or PUT.

2014-04-25T18:36:01  <jaybe> irctc140, a trailing slash is expected and normal.
2014-04-25T18:36:20  <jaybe> i.e. leave it alone and move on. ? why are you trying to solve this 'problem'?
2014-04-25T18:37:02  <irctc140> jaybe: Because the links on my website don't work. If I have a link to zaoyin.eu/folder and I click on that, the browser gets redirected to zaoyin/folder/ which is not a valid URL
2014-04-25T18:37:21  <irctc140> jaybe: When redirecting, it drops the .eu at the end
2014-04-25T18:37:50  <jaybe> irctc140, using the config i provided, restart nginx. next, quit your browser and don't reopen it. use `curl` to test web sites. browsers, especially chrome and the likes, suck, and aggressively cache and don't show you the truth.
2014-04-25T18:38:07  <jaybe> you don't need to be 'redirecting' anything

2014-04-25T21:46:27  <ice9> lewellyn: you mean nginx by default support download resuming? (wget --continue)
2014-04-25T21:48:30  <lewellyn> ice9: are you not seeing 206 or 416 on a Range request?
2014-04-25T21:50:49  <ice9> lewellyn: now I can see 206
2014-04-25T21:51:02  <ice9> and it's working
2014-04-25T21:51:40  <lewellyn> again, i'm trying to frame this in context of how nginx is misbehaving for you.
2014-04-25T21:52:33  <ice9> download resume wasn't working because I was handling the download by web application (flask) and now tried it directly from nginx and it's working
2014-04-25T21:52:36  <ice9> just noticed that
