2014-04-22T06:20:09  <atrioom> If I just want to match the URI and serve a specific file, I would not want to change the over all configured root just for that location. Is there a better way to serve special URI paths with content?

2014-04-22T06:20:29  <fl0w> atrioom: why don’t you just root within that location then?

2014-04-22T09:01:10  <yochai> hello. anyone awake?
2014-04-22T09:01:17  <BotoX> No.
2014-04-22T09:01:22  <yochai> oh, nevermind then.
2014-04-22T09:01:51  <yochai> I have a very simple, newbie-ish question
2014-04-22T09:01:56  <yochai> it involves aliases
2014-04-22T09:01:58  <yochai> I think.
2014-04-22T09:02:01  <BotoX> then simply ask
2014-04-22T09:02:07  <yochai> Ok, so coming from the apache world
2014-04-22T09:02:24  <yochai> basically, I have a site at my.domain.com
2014-04-22T09:02:34  <yochai> and i want to move it to my.domain.com/site1
2014-04-22T09:02:46  *** saml has joined #nginx
2014-04-22T09:02:49  <yochai> so i can have more sites on the same domain (not subdomains, necessarily)
2014-04-22T09:02:54  <yochai> like my.domain.com/site2
2014-04-22T09:03:03  <yochai> but I can't for the life of me figure it out
2014-04-22T09:03:20  <yochai> should I add an alias directive to my existing my.domain.com config?
2014-04-22T09:03:25  <saml> I want to have different proxy_pass for   /foobar  and for  /foobar?a=b    based on existence of query string "a=b"
2014-04-22T09:03:30  <saml> should i use if?
2014-04-22T09:03:32  <yochai> or should I create something else?
2014-04-22T09:03:33  *** john2x has joined #nginx

2014-04-22T09:03:43  <jaybe> yochai, site2 is just like site1
2014-04-22T09:03:53  <yochai> how so/
2014-04-22T09:03:54  <BotoX> location /site1 { alias /var/www/site1; }
2014-04-22T09:03:55  <jaybe> yochai, site1 works. repeat the process for site2 just like site1.
2014-04-22T09:03:57  <saml> yochai,   location /site2  { ... }   location /site1 {...}   ?
2014-04-22T09:03:58  <BotoX> something like this maybe?
2014-04-22T09:04:01  *** meson10 has quit IRC
2014-04-22T09:04:17  <yochai> ok, so if I currently have my.domain.com in /var/ww/my.domain.com
2014-04-22T09:04:23  <BotoX> saml, you could use a map too
2014-04-22T09:04:29  <saml> BotoX, map?

2014-04-22T09:05:44  *** nifoc has joined #nginx
2014-04-22T09:05:53  <BotoX> for "" use the default upstream/location
2014-04-22T09:06:02  <BotoX> and default the one for requests with args
2014-04-22T09:06:29  <yochai> Ok, sorry.  So if I have /var/www/my.domain.com - and it works - how can I move that to /var/www/site1?  I guess what I don't understand, is that right now my server responds to my.domain.com, and I need it to respond to my.domain.com/site1 - I guess that's where I'm confused.

2014-04-22T09:07:43  <jaybe> yochai, if you are just wanting to move the site' files/directory location, use the nginx `root` directive. nginx.org/r/root

2014-04-22T09:08:50  <jaybe> yochai, your existing site (should have) a `root` directive pointing to /var/www/example.com. if you wish that to be different, and or move, then move it and reconfigure the `root` directive

2014-04-22T09:22:27  <novochar> would creating another conf file like the first one except changing the server_name to example.com/bbb and line 2 to 127.0.0.1:8999 work?

2014-04-22T09:29:00  <GermanG> I've found out that if I specify the IP address in the listen directive, it takes precedence over the server_name's one, in http://p.ngx.cc/ff if I curl -H 'germang.localhost' 'http://127.0.0.1/' I hit "server_name ~.*" not "germang.localhost", is that OK or am I missing something?

2014-04-22T09:30:05  <kolbyjack> GermanG: server_name hashes are per-listen.  So if you have one server that explicitly listens on an ip:port, then all servers you want available there must also explicitly listen on it.

2014-04-22T13:18:45  *** crystal77 has joined #nginx
2014-04-22T13:19:06  <mdeboard> There are differences between the two, so I'm assuming x-real-ip and x-forwarded-for is the same way

2014-04-22T13:21:02  <gansbrest> Actually, I told incomplete story initially. Sorry about that ) So we use CDN on top of us and when request hits origin and Nginx, it loks like this http://pastebin.com/ykGFCsjF
2014-04-22T13:21:20  <mdeboard> Which CDN?
2014-04-22T13:21:31  <gansbrest> we want Nginx to write real client IP to its own logs
2014-04-22T13:21:32  *** yshh has quit IRC
2014-04-22T13:21:32  <mdeboard> Not CloudFront, I see
2014-04-22T13:21:41  <gansbrest> no, Fastly
2014-04-22T13:22:32  <gansbrest> so the question is - when Nginx gets that request, which IP will it write to its logs
2014-04-22T13:22:53  <gansbrest> as client IP
2014-04-22T13:22:54  <mdeboard> gansbrest: You may want to see how Fastly passes a reference on to the origin, if it does
2014-04-22T13:23:06  <mdeboard> I know CloudFront and akamai set X-Forwarded-For
2014-04-22T13:23:18  *** meson10_ has joined #nginx
2014-04-22T13:23:29  <gansbrest> yes, Fastly seem to do Fastly-Client-IP
2014-04-22T13:23:37  <mdeboard> gansbrest: You may want to just create a custom log format
2014-04-22T13:23:59  <gansbrest> but if we consider X-Forwarded-For for a second
2014-04-22T13:24:10  <mdeboard> But I may be misunderstanding your question... do you already know for sure there is a header containing the client IP, and you're just trying to sort out if/how it is getting logged?
2014-04-22T13:24:15  <gansbrest> it contains multiple values and it should be this way I assume
2014-04-22T13:24:52  <mdeboard> It can be, it's supposed to have multiple values for multiple hops. So it would probably have Fastly's edge location IP & your Nginx server IP when it gets to Apache
2014-04-22T13:25:04  <gansbrest> I know for sure there is header with client ip in the request called Fastly-Client-IP
2014-04-22T13:25:42  *** MaddinXx_ has quit IRC
2014-04-22T13:25:49  <mdeboard> And that is the thing you want to log, right?
2014-04-22T13:25:50  <gansbrest> I can update X-Forwarded-For header on Fastly side ( with VCL policy ) to be wherever I want
2014-04-22T13:26:09  <gansbrest> but then I will loose that chain of hops I guess
2014-04-22T13:26:34  <refefer> any thoughts on how to handle dynamic routing?
2014-04-22T13:26:53  *** meson10 has quit IRC
2014-04-22T13:27:50  <gansbrest> so if we look at that sample I sent you we have - X-Forwarded-For: 199.27.72.24, 199.27.72.24, 50.19.19.94
2014-04-22T13:28:02  <gansbrest> I assume  50.19.19.94 is the client ip?
2014-04-22T13:28:06  <mdeboard> gansbrest: Or you could just create a log format that logs $http_fastly_client_ip
2014-04-22T13:28:14  <mdeboard> Maybe, I don't know the order
2014-04-22T13:29:03  <gansbrest> but if I don't change anything - then nginx should log that whole string right? 199.27.72.24, 199.27.72.24, 50.19.19.94
2014-04-22T13:29:06  <mdeboard> Yeah

2014-04-22T13:40:35  <vandemar> refefer: need more details about how you want to programmatically update, and what "other such things" are.  Stock nginx you have to reload nginx to get it to reload the config, but you can change upstreams that way.  nginx plus (commercial offering) has an extension that allows live changes to upstreams.  But your load balancing options are still limited.

2014-04-22T16:11:02  <vandemar> itsMontoya: that's a mime type problem.  the alias doesn't have .js at the end I guess?
2014-04-22T16:11:17  <itsMontoya> Nope! :(
2014-04-22T16:11:24  <itsMontoya> Is there a way I can force type?
2014-04-22T16:11:27  <itsMontoya> Within the location
2014-04-22T16:11:52  <vandemar> !default_type
2014-04-22T16:11:52  <ngxbot> default_type is http://ngx.cc/r/default_type
2014-04-22T16:12:52  <vandemar> why don't you name the alias properly?  If it's js, name it something.js

2014-04-22T17:41:23  <gansbrest> then I have domain.conf
2014-04-22T17:41:29  <gansbrest> which looks like this

2014-04-22T17:41:47  <gansbrest>   server_name domain.com;
2014-04-22T17:41:55  <gansbrest> and your locations after
2014-04-22T17:42:35  <gansbrest> but for simplicity you can just modify nginx.conf, add you server there - that works too

2014-04-22T20:39:52  <vandemar> netusin: you've looked at network traffic to confirm nginx isn't hitting iis?  Because the proxy_intercept_errors directive means a 404 error will appear to come from nginx

2014-04-22T20:59:18  <vandemar> if the 404 is being generated by nginx, 404s it turns out are logged at level error, so there's something wrong that's not visible from that config, or I'm missing it

2014-04-22T21:05:33  <netusin> vandemar, thanks, I saw nginx in the response headers and didn't see it in the IIS logs, but I'd forgotten what the default nginx 404 looked like and it turned out that iis was giving a plain custom 404
2014-04-22T21:05:36  <vandemar> I'd blame ubuntu's package's startup script then

2014-04-22T23:14:47  <josePhoenix> I have a problem in nginx 1.1.19 where requests appear to be truncated. The behavior I'm seeing is an error saying "Invalid header: 'Hos'"
2014-04-22T23:15:04  <josePhoenix> Reloading nginx seems to get it out of whatever bad state it's in
2014-04-22T23:16:03  <josePhoenix> port 80 traffic goes to an nginx instance that then proxies to a second nginx instance (it's the second one that I reload to temporarily resolve the error)
2014-04-22T23:17:03  <josePhoenix> I'm not sure where to look to resolve this... I'm inclined to think my configuration is right, since it has worked for long stretches before...

2014-04-22T23:18:16  <josePhoenix> Has anyone seen or heard of behavior like this? Could the fact that I'm using UNIX sockets to proxy requests have something to do with it?

2014-04-22T23:22:07  <vandemar> that's an old version, can you replicate with the latest stable from nginx.org repos?
2014-04-22T23:23:07  <josePhoenix> is there a ppa for ubuntu? I'm on a LTS release, if I remember correctly

2014-04-22T23:25:26  <josePhoenix> Hmm, how likely is it that the config syntax has changed in a backwards incompatible way since 1.1?
2014-04-22T23:25:31  <josePhoenix> I might have to tackle this later
2014-04-22T23:25:38  <vandemar> unlikely
2014-04-22T23:25:48  <vandemar> some defaults may have changed though
2014-04-22T23:26:49  <josePhoenix> all right, something to try this weekend
2014-04-22T23:26:54  <josePhoenix> I'll keep reloading nginx every few hours
2014-04-22T23:27:26  <josePhoenix> thanks for the help
