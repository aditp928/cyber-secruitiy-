2014-04-30T05:08:16  <ksk> hey guys. im running nginx as an reverse proxy and Id like to modify the "502 bad gateway" errorpage. is there a way? i tried using error_page but then nginx tries to connect to "$backend-url/error503.html" which fails of course. any way to serve a local page in that setup? thanks!

2014-04-30T05:18:45  <kostil> hi all, I have a problem when I updated yesterday to newer nginx version via openresty package. I realize that I might be asking wrong community since it seems openresty is not official nginx port, but I can't find the answer and no irc channel for openresty. basically all of my POST requests which were working fine previously by redirecting calls from nginx to node.js are now returning 405 and I am breaking my head to understand why, since nothing has changed

2014-04-30T06:02:18  <ksk> as far as i understand returning a custom 503 error_page now, i would have to add an "/error" location to every vhost i have? because otherwise the error_page i can set in higher context will not know where to go? it would not be really cool to add an error location for every "vhost" - as we have a lot of them

2014-04-30T06:17:38  <ksk> `VL: i mean its not possible to just set an "error_page /var/www/error/403.html;" cuz it wants an URI, like "error_page /error/403.html" - so i will need to have an "/error" location to serve that file - which i do not have in an reverse proxy setup
2014-04-30T06:18:25  <ksk> and that location i would have to add in every "vhost" (which is an http block determined by server_name)

2014-04-30T10:11:31  <Aaruni> how do i convert rewrite codes from .htaccess to nginx counter-part ?
2014-04-30T10:12:52  <jaybe> Aaruni, you learn how nginx works enough to compose the configuration
2014-04-30T10:13:09  <jaybe> that implies you understand the apache rewrite rules by reading/comprehending them as well
2014-04-30T10:13:16  <jaybe> nginx.org/r/rewrite
2014-04-30T10:13:18  <jaybe> !regex
2014-04-30T10:13:18  <ngxbot> regex is Regex tutorial: http://regexone.com  ||  Interactive regex testing: http://regexpal.com  ||  Regex is like XML is like violence.  If it doesn't solve your problem, you aren't using enough of it.
2014-04-30T10:13:39  <Aaruni> jaybe, I don't understand those rules, or regex, or have the time to do so right now
2014-04-30T10:13:55  <Aaruni> is it possible that I paste my htaccess rewrite here, and then someone convert it for me ?
2014-04-30T10:14:06  <jaybe> Aaruni, then i presume you are hiring based on your time constraints and need?
2014-04-30T10:14:49  <Aaruni> jaybe, localhost server, because I wanted to switch from apache to nginx, but this school year is hectic, so, can't invest much time in hobbies.
2014-04-30T10:15:18  <Aaruni> for now, I just need something that will run. I'll look into how/why later on.
2014-04-30T10:15:27  <jaybe> Aaruni, you can use p.ngx.cc to provide pastes and ask in the channel; perhaps someone has time
2014-04-30T10:15:52  <Aaruni> ok, thanks

2014-04-30T13:10:11  *** smorin has quit IRC
2014-04-30T13:10:17  <jaybe> zeta`, not really; that doesn't really even make sense as far as i can fathom.
2014-04-30T13:10:33  <zeta`> yeah, thats what i thought, cant find anything on the net
2014-04-30T13:10:42  <zeta`> then I think i need to go with squid proxy or something
2014-04-30T13:11:53  <vandemar> I guess you could use the tcp proxy 3rd party module, but why would you want to?
2014-04-30T13:12:53  <jaybe> `socat` is also an option; just depends what you're actually trying to reasonably accomplish, and why
2014-04-30T13:13:12  <vandemar> you can set up a local ssh config file to bounce connections to remotehost2 through remotehost1.  you can use firewall-level redirection.  socat.  lots of options short of tcp proxying with a *web proxy*
2014-04-30T13:13:37  <zeta`> yeah, I thought of iptables to redirect but there will be to many rules in it? :/

2014-04-30T13:18:51  <vandemar> or whatever port you're going to use.  can't you bounce ssh through the host OS, or you don't want ssh running on the host OS?

2014-04-30T13:28:37  <vandemar> Gambit-: the commercial version of nginx supports on the fly reconfiguration of backends.
2014-04-30T13:28:48  <Gambit-> on the fly reconfiguration of backends?
2014-04-30T13:28:51  <Gambit-> can you point me at some docs on that?
2014-04-30T13:28:56  <Gambit-> or exapand?
2014-04-30T13:29:02  <vandemar> Gambit-: you want nginx to check signature on a signed cookie and use that to determine which backend to use?
2014-04-30T13:29:03  *** edudx has quit IRC
2014-04-30T13:29:46  <vandemar> Gambit-: on second thought I think that only allows general reconfiguration of proxies, nothing to do with mapping cookies to specific backends.
2014-04-30T13:29:47  <Gambit-> Yes - that's the conclusion I have.  An alternative would be something that the server returns to nginx (which nginx strips out and doesn't return to the client) to tell nginx where to send the clients connections to.
2014-04-30T13:29:57  <MaddinXx> vandemar: oh I see. seems like OpenSSL has no CFB supporting ciphers suites
2014-04-30T13:30:00  <vandemar> Gambit-: I think you're looking at writing your own nginx module if you want that.
2014-04-30T13:30:17  *** ndrei has quit IRC
2014-04-30T13:30:28  <Gambit-> vandemar, So there's no "make a lb pick based on this cookie" type functionality?
2014-04-30T13:30:36  <Gambit-> sticky persistence, for example
2014-04-30T13:30:46  <Gambit-> or cookie persistence is how we called it in the F5 world.
2014-04-30T13:30:47  <thresh> it's available in the paid version, yeah
2014-04-30T13:31:12  <vandemar> Gambit-: haha no.  and signed cookies would be even more 'no'.  Maybe you could do something with the lua module, but I'm not sure if there are lua bindings to pick a proxy backend.  If there is, that could work
2014-04-30T13:31:21  <Gambit-> isn't that https://code.google.com/p/nginx-sticky-module/ or http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html?
2014-04-30T13:31:34  <Gambit-> vandemar, why is it funny? :)
2014-04-30T13:32:25  <Gambit-> I mean, is it fnuny because nginx would never do that, or is it funny because that's the business model, or is it funny because it's a silly design? :)
2014-04-30T13:32:53  *** bkuberek has joined #nginx
2014-04-30T13:33:08  <vandemar> Gambit-: nginx doesn't tend to support advanced load balancing options.  Does that 3rd party module even compile against modern nginx?  And can't your app not be dependent on sticky backend associations with clients?
2014-04-30T13:33:53  <Gambit-> I have no idea if it compiles :)  I actually have a whole scaling set of sites tucked behind it, but users get sticky assigned to one on user creation rather than as a runtime request loadbalancing thing, so I need them to always go to the same one.
2014-04-30T13:33:56  <vandemar> Gambit-: if it did compile does it do what you want?
2014-04-30T13:33:58  <Gambit-> (there's a lot of other wierd stuff going on)
2014-04-30T13:34:05  <Gambit-> I have no idea, I haven't looked at it :)
2014-04-30T13:34:36  <Gambit-> but I'd at least assume the nginx.org site module will compile and run.
2014-04-30T13:35:08  <Gambit-> I'm just surprised there is no security involved in that cookie format.
2014-04-30T13:35:26  <vandemar> Gambit-: it looks like it's having nginx set the sticky cookie; so that cookie isn't from the app
2014-04-30T13:35:37  *** meson10 has quit IRC
2014-04-30T13:35:44  <Gambit-> sure, but I could set a sticky cookie on behalf of nginx so that subsequent requests have that cookie set.

2014-04-30T13:37:52  * vandemar would try to decouple subsequent requests so they can be served by any backend, if at all possible with your architecture.  or put another way: what if the sticky backend for a client dies?  are the backends redundant?
2014-04-30T13:38:35  <vandemar> if not, either the sticky requests fail or you already have the capability to serve the requests on any backend, you just don't want to?

Commercial nginx has on the fly tweaking of upstreams, but that isn't what you want, and I don't know if it has the additional capabilities that you want.  I think you're stuck with writing an nginx module, seeing if the nginx lua module (also 3rd party, but well maintained) has bindin

2014-04-30T13:50:26  <vandemar> Gambit-: it looks possible, but I haven't used the lua module for anything like this and I don't see the lua bound variable to select which upstream to send the request to.  the lua module docs say, as a typical use: "fetching backend information from external storage backends (like redis, memcached, mysql, postgresql) and use that information to choose which upstream backend to access on-the-fly," close enough to what you want that it's worth looking
2014-04-30T13:50:32  <MTecknology> If you have groups of backends, you could do the typical subdomain per backend

2014-04-30T14:29:59  <martian> so yes, I fully understand the benefits of ssl-all-the-things, but this is an exception I'm willing to accept :)

2014-04-30T14:33:27  <vandemar> mstratman: simply proxying shouldn't add more than a few ms.  Are the servers slow?  Did the fastcgi backend change to a slower server?
2014-04-30T14:33:55  <martian> I'm not sure I understand. There is one application running via nginx which actually involves authentication. That application is the one which I am redirecting to https in case the end user attempts to access it via http.
2014-04-30T14:34:18  <mstratman> vandemar: no, the new machine is an exact clone of the old  (using linode’s backup/cloning) with only different IP and hostname and other minor tweaks.  And the only change I made was nginx.. the backend is the same

2014-04-30T14:35:26  <vandemar> mstratman: point is, are you comparing old server vs new server, or have you tried the original config on your new server and verified it's 200ms also?
2014-04-30T14:35:43  *** parallel21 has joined #nginx
2014-04-30T14:35:54  <vandemar> vpses are not all equal.  your new vps neighbors might be using more resources than the vps neighbors on your old server
2014-04-30T14:36:03  <mstratman> that’s a good question, but I wonder if I can answer it more easily by simply removing the new server from the upstream pool
2014-04-30T14:36:24  <mstratman> and send 100% of requests to the old server. So it’s strictly a reverse proxying / nginx change
2014-04-30T14:37:02  *** th2389 has joined #nginx

2014-04-30T17:35:14  <buhman> or rather, should 10 clients simultaneously make 10MB requests, would nginx's maximum memory utilization be anywhere approaching 100MB?

2014-04-30T19:21:03  <Shin-Work> can anybody confirm or deny that ECDHE cipher combinations are only available with the latest nginx 1.7.0 ?
2014-04-30T19:22:18  <Shin-Work> my ssllabs testing on a target of either 1.5.x or 1.7.0 had shown that only the latter one has the elliptic curve ciphers active, despite release notes as far as 1.1.0 listing the feature.
2014-04-30T19:23:30  *** label has joined #nginx
2014-04-30T19:24:00  <vandemar> Shin-Work: wrong.  ECDHE availability does not depend on 1.7.0.  Works fine in earlier versions, at least the 1.4.x I was running not too long ago.
2014-04-30T19:24:33  <vandemar> Shin-Work: either the openssl didn't support it or your ssl_ciphers specification didn't include any ECDHE ciphersuites.
2014-04-30T19:24:53  <showaz> Shin-Work: ECDHE not nginx, openssl version
2014-04-30T19:25:17  <Shin-Work> mh. Something does not add up.
2014-04-30T19:25:24  <vandemar> Shin-Work: the nginx 1.5.0, is it by chance on RHEL/Centos?  Those openssl versions did not support ECDHE until very recently
2014-04-30T19:25:26  <Shin-Work> I have the latest EL clone openssl version available
2014-04-30T19:25:49  <Shin-Work> using the nginx versions from the nginx repo directly
2014-04-30T19:26:02  <Shin-Work> openssl does report all the wanted ciphers
2014-04-30T19:26:19  <showaz> centos sucks
2014-04-30T19:26:21  <vandemar> what's the nginx ssl_ciphers line?
2014-04-30T19:26:25  <Shin-Work> but only when I use the 1.7.0 nginx can the ssllabs test show them
2014-04-30T19:26:34  <Shin-Work> with the exact same config
2014-04-30T19:26:53  <Shin-Work> showaz, good thing am not using centos then :)

2014-04-30T19:58:01  <Shin-Work> Changes with nginx 1.1.0 01 Aug 2011
2014-04-30T19:58:01  <Shin-Work> *) Feature: now nginx supports ECDHE key exchange ciphers.
2014-04-30T19:58:01  <Shin-Work> Thanks to Adrian Kotelba.
2014-04-30T19:58:39  <vandemar> no.  because it's the same as openssl.
2014-04-30T19:58:51  <vandemar> oops, misfire
2014-04-30T19:59:08  <Shin-Work> 	libssl.so.10 => /usr/lib64/libssl.so.10 (0x00007f1e7eb5a000)
2014-04-30T19:59:09  <Shin-Work> 	libssl.so.10 => /usr/lib64/libssl.so.10 (0x00007f71bd587000)
2014-04-30T19:59:45  *** ogl92 has left #nginx
2014-04-30T20:00:36  <vandemar> yeah, so whatever's reported by openssl ciphers is available in nginx.  you must have a broken nginx config with extraneous ssl_ciphers lines or otherwise broken somehow.  are you restarting after a ciphers change?
2014-04-30T20:00:37  <showaz> $ yum whatprovides "*/libcrypto.so.10"
2014-04-30T20:00:45  *** CoreISP has joined #nginx
2014-04-30T20:02:04  <Shin-Work> vandemar; I tried several nginx config (some from nginx, some from qualys ssllabs) ALL gave the same result. nginx 1.5.x = no EC; 1.7=EC
2014-04-30T20:02:29  <vandemar> Shin-Work: is there something in front of nginx?
2014-04-30T20:03:15  <vandemar> Shin-Work: you don't need !DSS by the way.  if your cert is RSA, DSS ciphersuites can't be used.
2014-04-30T20:03:32  <Shin-Work> vandemar, now that is a good question. let me confirm
2014-04-30T20:03:38  <Shin-Work> vandemar, ok thanks
2014-04-30T20:04:06  <Shin-Work> showaz: using the latest; aka openssl-1.0.1e-16.el6_5.7.x86_64 - yum shows that and a whole lot of older ones

2014-04-30T20:10:01  <vandemar> ECDHE has worked fine for a long time.  you can stop citing release notes :)
2014-04-30T20:11:00  <vandemar> Shin-Work: what version of RHEL are the systems running?  latest 6.5 in both cases?
2014-04-30T20:11:52  <Shin-Work> that's right. It's actually the same system

2014-04-30T20:12:57  <vandemar> are any other packages changed when you do those updates and downgrades?
2014-04-30T20:12:58  <Shin-Work> then I only do service nginx configtest, then restart

2014-04-30T20:14:12  <vandemar> wait, is the 1.5.9 version statically linked against an older/crippled openssl?
2014-04-30T20:14:25  <vandemar> that ldd you showed is for 1.5.9 right?
2014-04-30T20:16:45  <showaz> maybe configure to build binary check ECDH (if disabled ECDH not supported binary )... ?
2014-04-30T20:17:16  <Shin-Work> showaz, the configure is nearly identical (no SSL differences that I can see)
2014-04-30T20:17:19  <orlock> I am migrating from apache to nginx for a dev webserver - is php-fpm my only choice for php handling?
2014-04-30T20:17:22  <showaz> dont used nginx 1.1, my first version 1.4
2014-04-30T20:17:23  <Shin-Work> vandemar, the ldd is indetical for both
2014-04-30T20:17:42  <Shin-Work> also there is no older openssl still in place
