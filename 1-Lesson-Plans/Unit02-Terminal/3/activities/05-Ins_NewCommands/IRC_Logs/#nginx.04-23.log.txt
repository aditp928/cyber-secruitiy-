2014-04-23T03:00:04  <absynth> basically you're telling nginx to proxy all requests to /node/* off to the nodejs server
2014-04-23T03:00:13  <merlincorey> anyone have experience with websockets?  I'm having problems cause binary protocol data is not properly being upgraded and sent along and I'd prefer to keep things in nginx rather than use something else for this back proxy

2014-04-23T03:01:38  <showaz>  nginx not full support websocket

2014-04-23T03:27:25  <absynth> i vaguely remember that websockets over ssl are not supported with self-signed certs on all browsers or so
2014-04-23T03:27:34  <merlincorey> absynth: yeah it's a valid certificate and signed and all that (it's not my personal thing, I am working on something for a client, they used go-daddy)

2014-04-23T05:11:52  <jillesme> I know this is bad practise, but is there some article online that tells me how I should do it?
2014-04-23T05:13:32  *** mdw has joined #nginx
2014-04-23T05:13:49  <`VL> jillesme: to listen at 80 nginx needs to be started as root. later, it can use different user.see nginx.org/r/user
2014-04-23T05:15:18  <`VL> jillesme: internet is full of articles telling how to do something, but they won't help unless you understand what you are doing and what do you want to achieve

2014-04-23T06:23:16  <davager> is there any good way on throttling requests? i have some peaks when google throws ~30% more traffic than usual, which then nginx sends to my php-fpm nodes that chokes
2014-04-23T06:23:27  <Hounddog> Good morning. I seem to be missing something here trying to redirect http to https http://pastebin.com/hhmbvNQ6 when using php i am loosing the post information
2014-04-23T06:24:44  <`VL> davager: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html
2014-04-23T06:28:34  <absynth> davager: i'm merely masking my own ignorance, but my comment for this question would be: "you don't want to throttle google"
2014-04-23T06:28:59  <absynth> a) the bot has its own throttling mechanism that backs off if it detects issues on your site during crawling (such as timeouts or 500s)
2014-04-23T06:28:59  <davager> thanks `VL, ive looked into it but ill guess i have to try it live :)
2014-04-23T06:29:23  <absynth> b) throttling can and will influence rankings (at least to my hearsay SEO knowledge)
2014-04-23T06:29:28  <davager> absynth: agreed, but i need to cut down the bursts since the php app cant be scaled on multiple servers (grmbl)
2014-04-23T06:29:45  <absynth> well, yeah, that sucks
2014-04-23T06:30:44  <davager> but theres just microbursts, that i want to limit somehow. so its either that they wait a bit longer or taking down and killing php-fpm completely
2014-04-23T06:31:12  <absynth> you can't just up the fpm child count a bit?
2014-04-23T06:31:43  <davager> its already running +1000 proceses :)
2014-04-23T06:31:54  <Hounddog> how to redirect and also keep the post values? it seems they are going missing...
2014-04-23T06:32:19  <absynth> i don't think that is possible at all
2014-04-23T06:32:26  <absynth> i mean, i don't think that's even part of the standard

2014-04-23T06:38:39  <Hounddog> `VL: yeah, not an issue then... i just had an error as i set the redirects on saturday and i recieve updates from instagram on http... so i just need to change the callback urls there

2014-04-23T07:28:39  <SafPlusPlus> Been googling and testing for a bit, but can't figure this one out. I want to achieve that browsers connecting to my server which don't support SNI get an error page explaining to them why they just got an ssl error and urging them to upgrade, instead of showing them the page they want. Looking at http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2010-July/021378.html I set up 1 default ssl server for '_' to present this error page.
2014-04-23T07:30:21  <SafPlusPlus> However, testing with an old XP+IE6 machine I still seem to end up at the correct server_name section, where I expected nginx to go for the default server section.

2014-04-23T07:37:04  <Peng> Hold on, though. server_name dispatch is 100% based on the Host header, right?
2014-04-23T07:37:24  *** macabre has joined #nginx
2014-04-23T07:37:36  <absynth> guess so
2014-04-23T07:38:04  <absynth> In this configuration nginx tests only the request’s header field “Host” to determine which server the request should be routed to. If its value does not match any server name, or the request does not contain this header field at all, then nginx will route the request to the default server for this port.
2014-04-23T07:38:09  <absynth> http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html
2014-04-23T07:38:12  <Peng> So users without SNI will get the default cert, click through the error because they are dumb (see: using a client without SNI support), and then get the right vhost.
2014-04-23T07:38:30  <absynth> according to the same page, the "empty server name" keyword is ""
2014-04-23T07:38:37  <absynth> Peng: exactly
2014-04-23T07:38:40  <Peng> That's empty, not default.
2014-04-23T07:38:45  <absynth> err, yeah
2014-04-23T07:38:56  <SafPlusPlus> Indeed, Peng, that's the behaviour that I see...

2014-04-23T10:00:03  <Conker> hey all, is there a recommended way to "strip" the first directory from the url? not rewrite / redirect, but just to change the nginx path where it will try and fetch the file
2014-04-23T10:00:24  <kolbyjack> !alias | Conker
2014-04-23T10:00:24  <ngxbot> Conker: alias is http://ngx.cc/r/alias ...but alias operates differently in regex vs non-regex locations, and symlinks probably do what you want with no nginx config at all.
2014-04-23T10:00:27  <jaybe> Conker, nginx.org/r/root ; nginx.org/r/alias
2014-04-23T10:01:13  <ahmedsamir_> Thanks <kolbyjack>
2014-04-23T10:01:16  <Conker> okay, i've seen alias, and it seems to work great for a location like "/something/" but what if i want it to match anything?

2014-04-23T10:40:18  <programmerq> cuebix-wk: you can mark any server block as default in nginx
2014-04-23T10:40:31  <programmerq> if you only have one, it'll be the default implicitly
2014-04-23T10:41:01  <cuebix-wk> ah i see. i guess the weird thing is i still have an apache server running on port 80 so i thought if it didn't match it would just ignore this config
2014-04-23T10:41:12  <cuebix-wk> but it sounds like i'll have to change my apache port and have it forward there, correct?
2014-04-23T10:41:14  <Madwill> Nobody can help with the rewrite rule ?
2014-04-23T10:41:20  <programmerq> and any other Host: portion the webserver receives that isn't a direct match for a non-default server block will be served by the default block
2014-04-23T10:41:30  <programmerq> if you have apache running on 80, then apache handles those requests.

2014-04-23T12:04:46  <programmerq> meson10: the nginx pattern starts to make more sense once you redundify your application servers

2014-04-23T12:06:23  <gansbrest> when passing request with X-Forwarded-For nginx seem to add it's own IP to the list. Is that default behavior?
2014-04-23T12:07:02  <meson10> programmerq A tangent question ... whats my best way to have the uploader_module working with the repository packages ? Its quite a pain to build from source.

2014-04-23T12:07:33  <programmerq> sorry :(
2014-04-23T12:07:41  *** codecowboy has quit IRC
2014-04-23T12:08:16  <meson10> programmerq ah no problem. How does one handle large file uploads in general using nginx ?

2014-04-23T12:10:07  <programmerq> meson10: I am personally a fan of shoving that off to another service
2014-04-23T12:10:13  <programmerq> like S3 or one of the many clones
2014-04-23T12:10:25  <programmerq> so I haven't had to do it in nginx
2014-04-23T12:10:30  <meson10> So more like upload directly from browser to S3 ?
2014-04-23T12:10:33  <programmerq> but the upload module is definitely a good way to go
2014-04-23T12:10:35  <programmerq> meson10: exactly.
2014-04-23T12:10:44  <programmerq> they can deal with that hard problem
2014-04-23T12:10:50  <programmerq> so you don't have to. :)
2014-04-23T12:11:03  <programmerq> but not everyone can do it.
2014-04-23T12:11:12  <meson10> Right. I get that. I will bother the jQuery guys to have the XHR upload issues I ran into :-)
2014-04-23T12:11:30  <rhoml> I would need to know what is the real use case of burst and nodelay on rate limiting

2014-04-23T15:26:44  <andschwa> just curious about conventions
2014-04-23T15:26:56  <andschwa> running into a conflict using /public
2014-04-23T15:27:09  <jaybe> andschwa, i usually store internet-served data as:  /srv/www/example.com/www/
2014-04-23T15:27:21  <marc_v92> andschwa: When you say "public files", are you referring to your sites media files (images, etc) or other files?
2014-04-23T15:27:43  <jaybe> andschwa, i keep things like git repos, sources, etc. in, e.g.  /srv/www/example.com/src,   ... /srv/www/example.com/notes .... etc.
2014-04-23T15:27:44  <andschwa> no, more like a directory listing, a few folders with PDFs
2014-04-23T15:28:01  <jaybe> andschwa, whatever you want
2014-04-23T15:28:14  <andschwa> apparently Ghost (coupled with a particular theme) puts jquery at /public/jquery.js, and so breaks when using an Nginx location for /public

2014-04-23T15:29:58  <jaybe> for js crap, i'd probably use something such as:  /srv/www/example.com/www/assets/js/jquery.js (which you should be referencing via an official cdn anyway rather than statically including with a theme/framework)

2014-04-23T15:30:47  <andschwa> that's the weird thing, it *should* be in assets, and isn't even located in public, that's just there it gets it. I think it's a bug, but I'm not much of a web developer
2014-04-23T15:31:08  <andschwa> the script throwing a traceback when trying to load jquery is minified :/
2014-04-23T15:31:17  <jaybe> it's probably simply the way the theme designer decided to lay out his files... and since you are using his work, well, you get what he wrote

2014-04-23T15:32:17  <andschwa> he seems to follow the assets convention, as that's what Ghost does as well; which is why it appears to be a bug that it's being grabbed elsewhere
2014-04-23T15:32:38  <andschwa> and I can't find any mention of jquery import in any of the files
2014-04-23T15:32:49  <andschwa> I've made an issue, hopefully the dev gets back soonish
2014-04-23T15:33:01  <andschwa> it's Ghostium, which for the most part is pretty well designed
2014-04-23T15:33:11  <andschwa> can you recommend a good jquery CDN?
2014-04-23T15:33:18  <jaybe> no

2014-04-23T16:48:22  <jaybe> zmilic, sure; just learn about `location` directive. nginx.org/r/location.  example:  location = /hbtest.html { ... }  ...  location / { ... the upstream ... }

2014-04-23T21:03:44  <[MT]> I assume nginx is running as www-data. Think about what the user www-data has access to from what you just pasted
2014-04-23T21:03:59  *** Es0teric has joined #nginx
2014-04-23T21:04:25  <Azelphur> www-data has access to read, write and execute /home/azelphur/omniwallet/www/index.html as it's in the www-data group
2014-04-23T21:04:39  <Azelphur> does it not?
2014-04-23T21:04:59  <[MT]> that depends on your definition of access
2014-04-23T21:05:13  <[MT]> look again at everything
2014-04-23T21:05:32  <Azelphur> I have looked at it, you'll have to point it out, I see no reason why the www-data user has no access to index.html
2014-04-23T21:05:58  <Azelphur> short of nginx wanting access to the full tree of files or something
2014-04-23T21:06:09  <[MT]> I do. It's right smack dab in your face in that last post
2014-04-23T21:06:17  <[MT]> of course it does
2014-04-23T21:06:23  <[MT]> that's how linux permissions work
2014-04-23T21:06:30  <[MT]> and *nix perms
2014-04-23T21:07:08  <Azelphur> [MT]: not to my knowledge, I just switched to some arbitrary user and cat'd index.html with no permissions issue.
2014-04-23T21:07:19  <Azelphur> that'd be nginx specific if it's the case, but I'll try it, ty :)

2014-04-23T22:38:59  <atula> [MT], you use zc.buildout?
2014-04-23T22:39:14  <[MT]> no
2014-04-23T22:39:32  <atula> I was supposed to create another site with Pelican... but I ended up learning about zc.buildout instead
2014-04-23T22:39:39  <lewellyn> it's just something you start noticing after many years of working with people of varying english competency. using the plural of "code" in that case is something some people never stop doing, for instance. especially if they learnt non-US english in a non-engish-speaking country.

2014-04-23T22:40:55  <atula> lewellyn, I think it's a 50/50 guess. The statistic is... ambivalent
2014-04-23T22:40:56  * [MT] is always right
