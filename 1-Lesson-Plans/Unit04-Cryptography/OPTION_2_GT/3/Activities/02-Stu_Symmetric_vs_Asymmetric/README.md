# Symmetric vs Asymmetric

In this activity, you'll determine whether symmetric or asymmetric encryption is the most sensible solution for the given scenario.

## Instructions

- You're a Space Trooper commanding a battalion of GalacTanks on Pluto, and need to ensure all of your captains can communicate with you securely. You're the only one they'll be sending messages to, and they need to be able to easily ensure their lieutenants can also communicate with you, if need be. Do you encrypt your communications channel with an asymmetric or symmetric cipher?

- Suddenly, you're a Space Pharmacist, and need to make sure your customers really are who they say they are before you give them their medications (running out is a big deal, since Earth is millions of miles away). Do you leverage symmetric or asymmetric key cryptography to check their identity?

- You need to tell your best friend you're struggling with having suddenly become a shapeshifter. You want to make sure it stays secret, but you don't have a lot of computing power. Do you use a symmetric or asymmetric cipher?

- Now you're back on Earth, but need to send directions to your planet back to your alien friends from Andromeda. It's _crucial_ that no malicious Martians intercept and modify the message, or they'll end up traveling billions of miles just to end up at the wrong party. How do you encrypt the message?

- After retiring from conquering the galaxy, you start up an ecommerce site. In order to protect your customers' personally identifiable information (PII), you encrypt it before storing it in your database. Symmetric or asymmetric?

- Finally: You're just about to submit your homework assignment, but want to make _absolutely sure_ your classmates don't plagiarize your work. You tell your teachers that you're going to encrypt your assignment before submitting it. Do you agree to use a symmetric or asymmetic algorithm to protect your integrity?
