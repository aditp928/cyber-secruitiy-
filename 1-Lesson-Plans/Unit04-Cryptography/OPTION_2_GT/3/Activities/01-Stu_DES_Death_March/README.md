# The Day DES Died

NIST used a competition model to land on a the standard that became AES. But such competitions are also used to determine which standards we should phase out.

RSA Security leveraged a similar model in their DES Challenges, in which cryptanalysts the world over applied themselves to uncover weaknesses in the Data Encryption Standard (DES), the precursor to AES. 

This exercise is your opportunity to learn more about it.
