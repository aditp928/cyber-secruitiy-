# Sharing Secrets...Secretly

## Instructions

- Imagine you have deeply sensitive data to share with your seat partner, like the location of a winning lottery ticket you've decided to split amongst yourselves; a coupon for a dozen, _free_ Sublime Donuts (arguably more valuable than the lottery ticket); etc.

- As security pros, you'd naturally encrypt this data using some modern standard like AES. Of course, this requires that you use a key to encrypt your message, and that your partner uses the same key to decrypt it.

- But there's a problem. You realize  that you remembered to give them your secret message after the last class, but _forgot to give them the key_ before heading back home.

- Here's the question: Can you think of a way to get your key to them, while _guaranteeing_ that _no one_ else could get their hands on it?

- Consider the following options.
  - Email?
  - Text message?
  - Snail mail?
  - Phone call?
