# Cleaning the Red Flag Sea
In this activity, you're going to write a script that searches a folder for any files that seem out of place. All of the files should be the same size and have bene modified around the same time ... but there are some that stand out.

## Instructions

### Option 1: Normal (Recommended to do this first)

- Update your Python script to ask the user if they'd like to delete any "stand out" files.

- If they say yes, delete any files that are not the expected file size (100 bytes)

#### Bonus

- Update your deletion condition to also delete any files which don't have the expected "last modified" date.

### Option 2: Challenge (If you're feeling confident and/or have finished Option 1)

- Have your Python script report the number of files, the folder size, and the average file size

- After reporting, your Python script should ask the user if they'd like to delete any "stand out" files.

- If they say yes, delete all of the files above the average size of the files in the folder.
