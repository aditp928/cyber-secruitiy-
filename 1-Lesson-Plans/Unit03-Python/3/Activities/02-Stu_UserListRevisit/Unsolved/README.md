# User List Revisited
In this activity, you're going to take some code that we built previously and incorporate some modules to make it more functional. This is good practice in refactoring code!

## Instructions

Convert the file to use the `open` and `csv` modules. This will require:

- Importing the appropriate modules

- Updating the way the file is opened and read

- Removing some unnecessary string management code

- Updating the way the code manages the data inside of the for loop.

If working correctly, the new file should output the exact same thing as the old file when run. However, you can now trust that this script will run successfully on any OS! On top of that, you are doing much less string manipulation, which helps to simplify your code.

## Bonus

- Update the code as necessary so that it uses the `in` operator to check for the IP in the list instead of `.find` and `> -1`.
