This year we are buying my mom a cruise vacation!  The whole family is going. Well the adults are. It should be a blast! We have ports at Mexico and jamacia… and some other little island.

I am already sooooo excited about the up coming holidays!!!!!!!

My sister and I booked ours quickly and was waiting on my brother to book his…we also were waiting for my mother’s cousin to decide if she was going or not! Stressing to wait on everyone because we were afraid there was not going to have any rooms left. We are buying my mothers cruise for her Christmas gift! Should be a blast!

Now I need to get my passport together…errr I know it is out dated too

I bought the cutest dishes!!!! They are cute little chefs! Short fat ones and tall thin ones… I love them! Soooooooooooooo now I plan to completely redo my kitchen! New fun chef wall border.

I am soooo excited for the holidays!!! I am getting close to being done too! Wooo Hooooo but I cheated because I am giving the boys each 1500 and they are doing their own shopping i also gave Lee’s Gf 300 to shop on… little surprises this year but everyone will be happy. I do have about 100 or so of little gifts for the boys ad their GF. I really only have Lanes gift to buys and his mothers gift. Plus the 2 gifts we draw on thanksgivng I am getting Kos GF a plain ticket to visit him this spring
