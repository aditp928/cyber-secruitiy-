Well i had a pretty good Thanksgiving. Lane had a crew of men working so he had to work Thanksgiving. Well not really work so much but he had to be there.

We had tons of good food and great company as Lane was the only one that couldn’t make it. We plotted our black friday at thanksgiving. We all had our newspapers and were ready to take charge of the sales. I was slightly disappointed in the sales this year. you would think if the economy was hurting they might be better? Macy’s had good sale prices but terrible coupons and virtually no one was in their store. it is all because of the coupons! People would rather pay higher prices and see that 10 dollar off one item coupon hahah

Well i am proud I have ALL my shopping done but Lanes! I am thinking about putting up my tree tomorrow. I am in the Christmas mood!!!

I spent the night at my mother’s on Thanksgiving and my boys came home to visit with Lane and I guess have a party in my house! Lee invited a couple friends over and they drank EVERYTHING in my bar up!

One of them managed to login to my account. They must have guessed my password was my mother's birthday. I really should change that.

Oh well, I will get around to it. For now... SHOPPING!
