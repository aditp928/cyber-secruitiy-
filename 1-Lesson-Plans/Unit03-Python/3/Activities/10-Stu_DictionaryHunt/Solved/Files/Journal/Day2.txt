Happy Halloween!

Wonder if any little spook will venture out this far? Doubtfulâ€¦ we seldom have any trick or treaters unless it is friends. We live too far out I always buy candy just in case and if we do get a few... they get lots! ðŸ™‚

What in the hell happened to the stock market yesterday? OUCH!
