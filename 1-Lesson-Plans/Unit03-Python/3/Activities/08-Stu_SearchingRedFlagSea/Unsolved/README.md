# Searching Red Flag Sea
In this activity, you're going to write a script that searches a folder for any files that seem out of place. All of the files should be the same size and have been modified around the same time ... but there are some that stand out.

## Instructions

- Write a Python script that reads through all of the files in the `Text` folder. The script should print out a line that looks like the following for each file:

  - `File Name, File Size, Last Modified Date`. For example:

    - `Text\zrJ1cdXhuZOB, 100, Sun Jul 29 10:55:57 2018`

## Bonuses

- Use a try/catch statement so that your program keeps running if it encounters an error with any of the files.

- Use Python f-strings in outputting the file data.

- Write a report to a csv file with the file data.
