# Conditional Conundrum

In this activity, you will be looking through an already written series of conditional statements and variables whilst attempting to uncover what statements will print from each code block.

## Instructions

* Update the comments in the code to say which line will print from each block of conditionals.

  * Do not run the code at first; see if you can follow the flow control to make informed guesses.

* Once you've added your comments, run the code to see if you guessed correctly.

### Bonuses

* Update the values of the variables to trigger the _other_ conditions in each block.

* Add `elif` statements to conditional blocks without them to print something of your choosing.
