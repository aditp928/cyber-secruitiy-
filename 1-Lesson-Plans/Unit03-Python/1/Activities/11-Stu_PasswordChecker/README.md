# Password Checker

* In this activity, you will create a command line application that asks users for their username and password. 

* If the username and password match those of the master username and password, alert them with a message stating: "You have been granted access!"

* If the username and password do not match those of the master username and password, alert them with a message stating: "You have been denied access!"
