# Inventory

## Instructions

- Create an empty dictionary, called inventory.

- Ask the user how many items they have in their inventory.

- Use `range` and `for` to loop over each number up to the inventory number.

- Inside the loop, prompt the user for the name of an item in their inventory ("What's the item? ").

- Then, prompt the user for the price of that item ("How much does it cost? ").

- Finally, put the item into the dictionary as the key, and associate it with its price.

- Outside of the loop, use `items` to print: "The price of <ITEM> is $<PRICE>.".
