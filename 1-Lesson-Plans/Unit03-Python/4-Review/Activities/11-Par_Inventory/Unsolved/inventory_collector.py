# TODO: Create an empty dictionary, called inventory

# TODO: Ask the user how many items they have in their inventory

# TODO: Use `range` and `for` to loop over each number up to the inventory number

# TODO: Inside the loop, prompt the user for the name of an item in their inventory ("What's the item? ")
# TODO: Then, prompt the user for the price of that item ("How much does it cost? ")
# TODO: Finally, put the item into the dictionary as the key, and associate it with its price

# TODO: Outside of the loop, use `items` to print: "The price of <ITEM> is $<PRICE>."
