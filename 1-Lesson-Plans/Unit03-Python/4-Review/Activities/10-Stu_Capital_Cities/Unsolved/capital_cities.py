# TODO: Choose five countries to use as keys. List their capital cities as values.

# TODO: Print: "The capital of <COUNTRY> is <CAPITAL>", for each country in the dict
# NOTE: Don't use a `for` loop--do it manualll, in three lines.

# TODO: Use `keys` to create a list of the countries in your dictionary, and store it in a variable
# TODO: Use a `for` loop to print: "My list contains the country <COUNTRY>"

# TODO: Use `values` to create a list of the capitals in your dict, and store it in a variable
# TODO: Use a `for` loop to print: "I've been to <CAPITAL>!"

# TODO: Use `items` to create a list of the key/value pairs in your dictionary, and store it in a variable
# TODO: Use a `for` loop to print: "The capital of <COUNTRY> is <CAPITAL>."
