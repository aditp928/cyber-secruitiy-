# Create User Functions

## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/create_user_solved.py](Unsolved/create_user_solved.py).

- Find the lines of code you use to collect user information. Wrap these in a function, called `collect_user_information`. This function should accept no arguments.

- `collect_user_information` should return a list containing the `username`, `email`, and `password` the user enters, in that order.

- Next, find the lines of code you use to create a new user. Wrap these in a function, called `create_user`. It should accept three arguments: `username`, `email`, and `password`.

## Hints

- You **do not** need to write any new logic, other than the `return` statements at the end of `collect_user_information`, and at the end of the the `if` block in `create_user`. Your task is only to wrap this code up into functions using the `def` keyword.
