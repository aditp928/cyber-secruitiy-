THEY HAVE DONE IT AGAIN! HOW DARE THEY!
THIS TIME I HAVE COME UP WITH THE MOST EVIL, MOST POWERFUL PASSWORD OF ALL TIME!
MUAHAHAHAHAHA! TREMBLE IN FEAR OF howard!

Your objective is simple: Criminal Activities
Your motive is a little bit more complex: Hatred for all mankind

Stage One:

To begin your plan, you must first Blackmail a Town Mascot. This will cause the world to sit up and take notice, stunned by your arrival. Who is this Threat to our Children? Where did they come from? And why do they look so good in a Supervillain Costume with Incredible Gimmicks?

Stage Two:

Next, you will Steal the Moon (ooh, tides!). This will cause countless hordes of Mean English Teachers to flock to you, begging to do your every bidding. Your name will become synonymous with the Spice Girls, as lesser men whisper your name in terror.

Stage Three:

Finally, you will Covertly Move your Armies of Destruction, bringing about an Unending Cacophony of Screams. This will all be done from a Fake Mountain, an excellent choice if we might say. These three deeds will herald the end, and the citizens of this planet will have no choice but to elect you the NEW SPICE GIRL! EVIL SPICE!
