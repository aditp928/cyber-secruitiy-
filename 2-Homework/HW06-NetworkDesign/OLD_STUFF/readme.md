There's good news and bad news.

Good news is, everyone in the division is impressed that you've been configuring networks *and* analyzing their traffic. 

Bad news is, now you're the point person for everything.

After you took a thorough look at traffic on the wire last week, there's been a lull in intrusion alerts. Looks like attackers figured out they have better chances elsewhere.

That means you've got bandwidth to take care of two network problems for some of our big-name clients.

You'll find instructions in the case briefs. In each case, we'll need you to submit a Packet Tracer file (`.pkt`) containing your simulated network.

**Good luck!**
