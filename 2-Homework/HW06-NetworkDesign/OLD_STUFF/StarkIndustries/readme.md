# Trouble at Stark Industries

**This is an emergency**.

Ultron recently broke into Tony Stark's personal server. Not only did he block Tony's favorite websites (`reddit`, `richpeoplerule.com`, and `imbetterthanbatman.org`)â€”he caused a server outage as well. 

Your job is to take a look at the network and diagnose the problem, so that each computer on the network can once again talk to each other.

Oh, and FYI: We have intel that Iron Man gets snappy when he's bored. So...it's best you hurry.

## Instructions

- Ultron did a good job covering his tracks. You're just going to have to dive in, and find every issue you can. 

  - Luckily, one of the top scientists took a photo on his first day of work. This is probably another security problem we should fix...But in the meantime use it as a reference for how to restore the broken network.
